    <p>They continuosly FAIL to manipulate me</p>
    <text>why i dont interact with my colleagues and teachers? cuz i think that is going to be fking waste
        of time for me. I dont wanna say it but my clg (<note>and others</note>)
        + the Education System has become a CULT. Plus there is also a few students who just always wants to
        dominate each and every environment. Anything goes slightly against
        their plans and they will start a drama (<note>to catch attention</note>). In my first yrs I didnt
        understand wtf
        is wrong. Cuz I didnt know back then that this kinda shitty
        syndrome was a thing. Funny thing is infact a guy in my class had multiple face off with that dude.
        He literally dropped out in 3rd sem just becuz he couldnt bear with that kinda shit (<note>Although
            he
            himself was kinda partially responsible in that scenario. Moreover he was also financially
            independent through his online business (<note>seemingly..</note>)</note>). Before getting
        admission to any clg or
        university I have gone through tones of
        vdos-blogs-discussion_forums(<note>all affiliated to Indian Edu system</note>)
        and also Quora('<note>..Im really sorry for my past self but hey, u learn from ur mistakes:)</note>
        '). What I got
        from all these is no matter how worse ur clg is, u will meet people who will be contrary to the main
        stream. For example, creating helpful and interesting Repositories, understanding the concepts and
        algorithms of COmpetitive Programming and its implication in real
        life problem solving, getting our hands dirty in open-source projects. I had read about such stories
        alot. But ohh my poor soul... \'Always expect the unexpected\'. Now Im in 4th semester and what I
        understand is all they
        want is their teachers(<note>75% of whom r shitty in their own way. Most of these people are only
            2-3 yrs
            older than us</note>) and peers' attention, getting laid(i.e. the guys) and getting
        into a relationship(i.e. the girls), maintaining their domination etc. These seems to be more worser
        than typical Engineering Clg bulling (jking :), that kinda bully
        is very rare nowadays). After completing BTech, they all r planning to give the GATE(<note>for which
            they
            have absolute 0 passion</note>) and enroll in MTech course(<note>or prepare of Govt jobs(<note>
                sighh.. thats a whole
                another story</note>) and from there to MBA/PHD (<note>as long as their \"frnds\" doing the
                same</note>) and then
            marriage(<note>4 girls who failed to land a job; 4 boys, its going to be pretty difficult</note>
            )</note>). Most of such
        people will then end up as a teacher in a Pvt Clg or University(<note>like my current teachers
        </note>). As long
        as u r a member of this cycle, society(<note>fsociety btw</note>) will consider u as Normal, Future
        of the
        Nation, Educated and A worthy Human Being for producing child (<note>not jking</note>). But if u r
        someone who is
        outta this cycle, in the eyes of society(<note>fsociety again btw</note>) u became, WOrthless, An
        uneducated
        filthy
        soul, A waste of Oxygen, Introverted piece of sh't and thus u slowly start get isolated(<note>99.99%
            of
            these victims r
            males</note>).<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Shepherd/Quotes" target="_blank"> As
            Gen.
            Shepherd
            said, "Boundaries shift, new players step in; but power always finds a
            place to rest its head"</a>. They are just so much indulged
        into fake frienship that it gives me a kind of anxiety(<note>btw this isnt like Social Anxiety; its
            like
            ur r naked & unarmed amid a bunch of psycopathic thugs with AR, Glock and knife</note>).
        From my past experience from my High School I think faking friendship with them is valueless for my
        life. Main reasons for me to choose that clg is , 1. Fees Structure,
        2. Ease of travel, 3. Less amount of mandatory strict rules compared to other clgs. So yeah, 4 and a
        half semesters to go and Im getting outta this CULT.</text>

      <title>Seniors and colleauges demanding ‚Çπ1000 for College Fest</title>

      <p>- I replied.</p>
      <text>Seriously, how the hell do they expect someone who is not willing to attend the fest will give
      them their demanded money. They even warned me (kinda indirectly..) about my next visit to
      college. The guy who called me described himself as a 4th yr ME student. And he was probably
      provoked by one of my colleauge(M Raptan). <a href="https://iiekalyani.github.io/students/"
      target="_blank">Here are details about some of the regular male students of 2nd yr.</a> </text>

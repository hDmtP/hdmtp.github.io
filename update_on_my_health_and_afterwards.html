                        <p>Its strange how I slowly just lost control on my body. Looking into it now it really
                            feels weird. Why does the pain in the bones become so unbearable? This fever really hampered
                            a whole week of my schedules. Below are all the logs:</p>

                            <li>
                                <time>1417</time>
                                No internet. Called my ISP at around ~1220 to enable my internet, will pay later at
                                noon today. He said ok. But internet didnt come.
                                Later this day I found the isp office closed. Probably out for some construction work.
                                So I used mobile network. Managed to get all the emails and notifications. But sadly no
                                youtube vdo.
                                Waked up at 1200 today. Couldnt sleep in night due to this unexpected buldge below the
                                top
                                of my tounge. God it hurts.
                                Along with my mother I am also feeling a bit weaker than usual. A bit dizziness, pain in
                                the
                                bones, typical fever symptomps.
                                Many other peoples are also getting the same symptomps. Some are saying this could be
                                due to
                                the 4th covid wave. While this
                                can be the case but neither me and my mother are facing any breathing problem (for
                                now..)

                                Btw 5th sem offline class starts from today. From whatsapp group it doesnt seem like
                                many

                                Im having a high fever. News says many people have already been suffering from the 4th
                                covid wave.
                                Dunno what will happen to me. Even if I will return back to this PC again. Im saying
                                this cuz
                                Im terribly ill. My body is full of pain.

                                Have been trying to connect to the internet from 1030. But my fucking router is horse
                                shit. Dont know wtf is wrong with it. I did everything
                                to ensure that it works but all in vain till now.
                                Btw fever update : had a hard time sleeping in the night. Headache and unbearable pain
                                in the knees didnt let me sleep. I also tried puking but
                                that didnt work.
                                Right now I am feeling dizziness in head.

                                Finally I developed it. Some issues to be addressed :
                            <li>If I press "." first, the calculator breaks</li>
                            <li>Cant display "0" in the `currenOperand` when the calculator is freshly loaded</li>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ngl all these npm packages, their own third-party dependencies, sudo permission for executing
                            poses a HUGE security threat to the system. NodeJS in linux is nightmare. All the time you
                            have to
                            type sudo password for saving files. Sucks!

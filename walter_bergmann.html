            Your life journey is about learning to become more of who you are and fulfilling the highest, truest
            expression of yourself as a human being. Don’t wait for the perfect moment, take the moment and make it
            perfect. If someone tells you „You can’t“, they are only showing you their limits, not yours! Everything is
            possible as long as you put your mind to it and put the work and time into it!</li><br><br>

            Ascension is the triumph of mastered emotions; a process of gaining clarity in the darkness of blind spots
            and struggles, allowing you to perceive with the karmic intelligence of the soul. Every positive change -
            every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness - involves a rite of passage. Each time to ascend to a
            higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort, of initiation.
            Great leaders don’t set out to be a leader, they set out to make a difference. It’s never about the role,
            it’s always about the goal.</li><br><br>

            Have no regrets, regrets are meaningless because you can’t change yesterday or tomorrow, you can only change
            this present moment. Your past is done, and your future is yet to come. Never regret a day in your life:
            good days give happiness, bad days give experience, worst days give lessons, and best days give memories!
            Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can’t change.</li><br><br>

            Focus means eliminating distractions, not just from other people, but the things we do to distract
            ourselves. Focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses. Focus on your character, not your reputation. Focus
            on your blessings, not your misfortunes. Focus on the possibilities, not on the potential for failure. The
            direction of your focus is the direction your life will move. Let yourself move toward what is good,
            valuable, strong and true.</li><br><br>

            It doesn’t matter who you used to be, what matters is who you decide to be today. You are not your mistakes.
            You are not your mishaps. You are not your past. You are not your wounds. You can decide differently today
            and at every moment. Remember that. You are offered a new opportunity with each breath to think. Choose,
            decide, and act differently in a way that supports you in being all that you are capable of being. You are
            not less. You are enough!</li><br><br>

            family and good friends. Work hard. Don’t be afraid to cry or laugh. Be inspired and inspire others. Love.
            Turn off the TV and go outside. Sing like no one is listening and dance like no one is watching. Stop
            searching for true love, it will find you! Learn something new every day and share it with someone. Be
            passionate about the ones you love. Follow your dreams and let them take you to new places. Be an
            individual, others will respect you for it. Introduce yourself to new people. Know your faults and strive to
            be a little better every day. Stop worrying and start trusting! Live in the present and plan for the future.
            Forgive and forget. Be merry and seize the moment. Travel often, smile often, love often. This is your Life!

            Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up, with goals so strong that obstacles, failure, and
            loss only act as motivation. Let them judge you, Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about you. Let
            them sleep while you grind. Let them party while you work. Their opinions are not your problems.The
            difference will show. Work hard and mindfully in silence, do what you have to do, and ignore the drama and
            negativity surrounding you. Let your success be your noise!</li><br><br>

            There is no shame in having fallen. Nor any shame in being born into a lowly estate. If one dream should
            fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again. Most
            of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there
            seemed to be no hope at all. Don’t downgrade your dream just to fit your reality, upgrade your conviction to
            match your destiny! Go as far as you can see and you will see further. TRUST YOURSELF!</li><br><br>

            Wake up with Determination. With one idea in mind: To be successful, to make it, to see progress, to get
            closer to your goal because the difference between your dreams and your reality shortens the more you hustle
            and grind. Ignite your passion for action, stop waiting on luck and make your move. You’ve done it before
            and you can do it now. Redirect the substantial energy of your frustration and turn it into positive,
            effective, unbreakable &amp; unstoppable determination.<br><br>I know it’s the same song „Everyday Hero“
            was, but it got a new meaning to me.</li><br><br>

            No matter what happens, no matter how far you seem to be away from where you want to be, never stop
            believing that you will make it. Have an unrelenting belief that things will work out, that the long road
            has a purpose, that the things that you desire may not happen today, but they will happen. Continue to
            persist and persevere, so that you can reap what you sow. Make your daily commitment:<br><br>I will persist
            until I succeed! I was not delivered into this world into defeat nor does failure course in my veins. I am
            not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd, I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with
            the sheep. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny. I will persist until I succeed!</li><br><br>

            A strong, positive, and untamable will is an unbreakable shield against all negative forces and experiences.
            Whatever you hold in your mind will tend to occur in your life. If you continue to believe as you have
            always believed, you will continue to act as you have always acted. If you continue to act as you have
            always acted, you will continue to get what you have always gotten. If you want different results in your
            life or your work, all you have to do is change your mind. Stop letting society tell you how to think and
            live your life, and start acknowledging you desires, dreams, and wishes. Start expressing your creativity,
            and make your own happiness. Start positive thinking and believing in yourself, and rise up like an endless
            crescendo!</li><br><br>

            The only way to stop being defined by what you don’t want to be, is by not being that person. Ignite an

            yourself. The YOU in the raw. Healthy and authentic.</li><br><br>

            Somehow we’ve come to believe that greatness is only for the chosen few, for the superstars. The truth is,
            greatness is for us all. This is not about lowering expectations; it’s about raising them for every last one
            of us. Greatness is not in one special place, and it’s not in one special person. Greatness is wherever
            someone is trying to find it. Rise from the ashes and become the phoenix. Let your glory and wisdom keep

            The essence of procrastination lies in not doing what you think you should be doing, a mental contortion

            about procrastination: although it seems to involve avoiding unpleasant tasks, indulging in it generally
            doesn&#39;t make people happy.<br>Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and
            its toll on success and happiness is heavy. Know the true value of time; snatch, seize, and enjoy every
            moment of it. No idleness, no laziness, no procrastination: never put off till tomorrow what you can do
            today.</li><br><br>

            You have that it takes. You are strong and brave. You are capable and worthy. it is time to stop thinking
            otherwise and start believing in yourself because no one else has the dreams that you have. No one else sees
            the world exactly like you do, and no one else hold the same magic inside. It’s time to start believing in
            the power of your dreams. Not next year, not next month, not tomorrow, but NOW!<br>Remember all the time you
            have been criticising yourself and it hasn’t worked. Try approving of yourself and see what happens. You are
            ready. You are more than ready. You are absolutely ready to finally become the person that slumbers inside
            you all your life. Wake it up.</li><br><br>

            A beautiful song by Andreas Kübler, and this is how he describes it: &quot;It’s an epic vocal track which is
            about a life that you only pretend to have, but this reality is much more pleasant and therefore you accept
            it as truth.&quot;</li><br><br>

            We are limitless. We do not fear any barricades that are erected before us, because we know, they are here
            to help us to improve ourselves. They show us how to think and act to achieve our goals and become superior.
            Many people don’t see the truth behind them, show fear and turn away, which means that they give up. But we
            are different. We are a different breed. We know the only way to get ahead in life is to work with all the
            barricades together that we are going to face. Yes, I said to work with them, not against them. They are not
            here to stop us, they see our potential, and want us to see it as well. So they rise up in front of us,
            forcing us to take action, and reveal who we can be.</li><br><br>

            You are a blessing. I just want to let you know that! Don’t compare yourself to others, you are perfect in
            the way you are, and even if it’s not always obvious for you, you are a blessing to others. I am happy that
            you exist, I am happy that you are among us. You deserve nothing less than a fullfilled life with joy and
            happiness, with people that care about you, and with love that warmth your heart. Life can be hard and dark,
            and there are days where you may feel unfairly treated and worthless. But you are worthy, you were created
            for something, you wasn’t created for nothing. Life just wants to show you how not to live it, even when
            it’s in a painful way. You may not understand it in the first place, but you will in the end. You will
            realize that life’s intention was it to show you the way you should go to have a life that you deserve.</li>

            afraid of. You show us that you can&#39;t fall far enough to not be able to get up again. Your stories

            Nothing beats passion. It was passion that brought society real progress. With passion comes motivation,
            with motivation comes persistence, and with persistence comes talent, genius, education, wisdom, believe and
            knowledge. Or simply said: Progress. Think about it. All these great persons in our history like Einstein,
            Tesla, Bell, Newton, Mozart, Beethoven, Montessori, Mother Teresa, Lincoln, Edison, Franklin, etc. They had
            one thing in common: Passion, they loved what they did, no matter how many people mocked at them, or spat at
            them. Despite the days of despair and self-doubt, they kept listening to their hearts, to keep believing in
            their aspirations as they knew, this will bring mankind further. And it did. Thanks to all these great
            personalities, we are today where we are today. Thanks to all of them, new horizons have been opened up to
            us that we never thought possible before. Imagine if they gave up, because of the clueless society that
            claimed them as stupid and crazy, or because of other reasons.<br><br>What I want to tell you with that is,
            don’t stop! DON’T STOP! What you have inside is a treasure of immeasurable value. You are precious, and one
            reason we will gain progress. People will see your love, and the right ones will come to you. Your love is
            contagious. I won’t stop neither. Let us continue together loving what we do, and bring mankind further,
            again :)</li><br><br>

            Don’t limit yourself with a small mind. With a small mind you refuse yourself to grow, to change, or to
            understand. When I think back of my narrow-minded episode, and I don’t talk about life-themes only, I had
            narrow perspectives in the areas music, movies, society, books, politics, cloth, … simply said in
            everyday-topics, I am so happy that I managed to tear down the wall of selfrestriction. When I began to open
            up my mind to other music, other movies, other books, other people, etc., to think different about
            everything, I was gifted with the divers beauty of life, I finally saw what I have missed, or what I was
            going to miss when I kept going. I have met people that I would never have met with the old me, or I
            listened to music which I claimed as garbage before, and so on. With this switch of thinking I allowed
            myself to grow, to change, and to understand. It shows me the beads of life and it made me to try out new
            things, so that I discovered new facets of myself, which I would have never seen with my old me. And now I
            am in this endless circle: I open up myself, I try new things, I discover new facets about life/me, I open
            up myself, I try new things, I discover new facets about life/me,…<br><br>You may know this sentence which
            says: “Think big.” I say, think horizontal, just look at the picture, if you follow the narrow road, you
            have also big houses, but it’s always the same. You are going to miss so much, only by not making the step
            to see what’s in the side streets. Think horizontal, and unfold the true variety of life, and yourself!</li>

            It is so beautiful to wake up every morning and have the sun shine on my face. Every day gives you a new
            chance to take opportunities, to take possibilities, to try things that you never did before, to change the
            way you look at life. It all starts with a morning routine, which is, in my opinion, by far the utmost
            important part of the day. How you start your day will help you to shape and define who you are, or who you
            want to become. By establishing a morning routine you’ll make yourself more energetic, more motivated, more
            confident, more disciplined, more positive, and more balanced. I feel it by myself since I have built up

            Absolutely beautiful and absolutely enough. There is no justified reason to change anything on you, because
            the way you look like is already stunning and captivating. Think about how far you have got in your life,
            how many dark times you have passed, how much pain you have endured, how many changes you have gone through.
            It’s outstanding. You are a true example for us, from which we can learn life-lessons. I mean it. Your whole

            Everyone has a purpose in his life. You were created for something, you wasn’t created for nothing. Your
            existence has meaning, it has reason. Forget about whatever financial disasters you’ve had, personal
            failures, relationship failures. We define ourselves far too often by our past failures. We look at our past
            and say: “Well, that’s me.” That’s NOT you, you are this person right now. You are the person who has
            learned from those failures and you can choose to be the hero of your own life right now. Write down your
            goals, write down things you want to improve, write down things you won’t tolerate from yourself, write down
            things that you’ve done in the past that you never want to see yourself again. And go forth, from here, as
            the hero of your own life. Build momentum. Build confidence and momentum with each good decision that you
            make from here on out. You can do it, anyone can do it. We live in unique times. We live in one of the
            rarest times in human history where you can choose almost all the input that comes your way, whether it’s
            the movies you watch, the books you read, the podcasts you listen to. You can choose to be inspired. Do

            Sometimes when something doesn’t work out as you wanted, there’s something better coming your way. Although
            it’s difficult to believe in something better from where you stand, sometimes redirection is a helpful
            intervention, leading you away from problems you could not predict, and towards benefits you could not
            imagine. Sometimes mistakes lead you to lessons learned and growth gained - all of which help you to become
            more - and get more - than you might have become and gotten otherwise.</li><br><br>

            Many people, me included, are asking themselves one specific question over and over again through their
            whole life: What if….? What if I had choose different in that situation 5 years ago? What if I would have
            done XY? What if I have said this or that back there? What if….? <br>But let me tell you something, and I
            say this to me as well, it DOESN’t MATTER. Who knows what would have happened to you, if you would have done
            this or that years, or months ago. Take a close look to your decisions and realize how they made an
            contribute to the person you are today. What if I had decided different? Then maybe I would not live in this
            home, I would not have this mindset, not this personality, this humour, this heart, or this soul. I would
            not have the specific people around me, this education, this love, this passion, this thinking. Maybe I
            would have become the complete opposite of me, and I know I wouldn’t be proud of that. So thank you for all
            the decisions I made in my life so far, because thanks to them I can look in the mirror and say: <a
                href="http://this.is.me/">This.Is.Me</a>.<br><br>Do not burden yourself with what could be or should be,
            it doesn’t matter. We grow and evolve from our actions. That is the purpose of decisions. I do not regret
            that there was a time, where I was unreflected, inpatient, choleric, naive, and narrow minded. I learned and
            now I am a better version of myself. I know there will always be situations in which my older me will show
            up, but I also know, it will happen more and more less., because I am aware of myself. Do not regret :)</li>

            We are all faced with challenges at some point in our life, challenges that we did not create. Challenges
            that happened beyond our control. The difference is how we respond to these challenges. You can adopt the
            attitude there is nothing you can do, or you can see the challenge as your call to action. Never let the
            odds keep you from pursuing what you know in your heart you were meant to do.</li><br><br>

            One day, you are going to realize that you are important. This day may come after years, or perhaps your
            whole life, of feeling unimportant. It will be a very happy day for you, because finally you know the truth
            of yourself, and it will be a sad day too. Because you’ll know that you wasted years of your life believing
            something that was never true. It doesn’t make sense to call ourselves ugly, because we don’t really see
            ourselves. We don’t watch ourselves sleeping in bed, curled up and silent with chests rising and falling
            with our own rhythm. We don’t see ourselves reading a book, eye fluttering and glowing. You don’t see
            yourself looking at someone with love and care inside your heart. There is no mirror in your way when you’re
            laughing and smiling and happiness is leaking out of you. You would know exactly how bright and beautiful
            you are if you saw yourself in the moments where you are truly yourself. You deserve happiness. And I mean
            real happiness; true happiness. The kind of happiness that makes your heart fill with warmth. And you
            deserve to feel what it feels like to be okay. To feel like the world isn’t against you. To feel like you
            aren’t constantly treading water just to keep from drowning. More than anything, you deserve to be okay.
            Restore the faith in yourself!</li><br><br>

            Hello dear all!<br>Here I am, back. The time away from this whole Song Mix thing was very needed, and
            didn&#39;t expect to ever do it again, but since the last days I started to miss it, to do song mixes and
            share them with you :)<br>So I decided to make song mixes again, but irregulary, so please note that I

            Life is all about a new beginning and every beginning has a successive end. Each chapter of life teaches us
            a lesson. You can’t start the next chapter of your life, if you keep on re-reading the last one. So, take
            the lesson from the last chapter and keep on going ahead. Close the door to your past and open the new one
            to step through right into your future. Take a deep breathe and start anew. Do what you love, and love what
            you do. Open your mind, arms and heart to new things and people, and seize the opportunities. Live your

            You can rise up from anything. You can completely recreate yourself. Nothing is permanent. You’re not stuck.
            You have choices. You can think new thoughts. You can learn something new.<br>You can create new habits.
            Don’t let this world make you bitter. Don’t let the actions of other people turn you cold on the inside.
            Certain things happen that hurt us, people come that leave us, and most of all there are moments when you’re
            bound to fall. Don’t let those things make you unkind. It’s okay to cry. It’s okay to be sad. But it’s never
            okay to do other people wrong just because you were done wrong. We’re human. We break. We make mistakes. But
            don’t let pain and sadness run your lives. Wake up in the morning and do what you think is right. There are
            moments in your life where you feel like giving up and you can’t take it anymore. It’s okay. Breathe.
            Inhale. Exhale. The things that show your weak side are also the same ones that make you stronger in the
            long run. It’s all about taking whatever life throws at you and learning from it. You are not the same
            person you where ten years ago, ten months ago, or even ten minutes ago. Rise Up!<br><br>For those, who also

            Never back down. Always wake up with a smile knowing that today you are going to have fun accomplishing what
            others are too average and afraid to do. Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up, with goals
            so strong that obstacles, failure, and loss only act as motivation. Start by doing what’s necessary, then do
            what’s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. Regardless of the situation, no matter how
            hopeless the outcome may be, never quit and never back down!</li><br><br>

            As we grow older and wiser, we begin to realize what we need and what we need to leave behind. Sometimes
            there are things in our lives that just aren’t meant to stay. Sometimes the changes we don’t want to make
            are the changes we need to grow. And sometimes walking away is as step forward. Walk away from all the drama
            and people who create it. Surround yourself with people who make you laugh. Forget the bad, and focus on the
            good. Love the people who treat you right, pray for the ones who don’t. Life is too short to be anything but
            happy. Falling down is a part of life, getting back up is living. You deserve it :)</li><br><br>

            Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience,
            and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world. Stop using other people’s measuring sticks to
            rate your success. There will always be someone with more clients, more money, a more successful business,…,
            and you’ll end up feeling frustrated or constantly chasing success. Instead, set your own measure. Do what
            feels good. Be of service. Reach for your own stars. And be happy. And be patient. If you master patience,
            you will master everything else. Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order
            than the one you have in mind. The biggest things we ask for in life rarely happen exactly when we ask for
            them, nor do they typically come from who or where we expect. They usually come a bit later, from someone or
            somewhere we didn’t even know existed when we first asked, as a result of some weird turn of events that
            were impossible to foresee. The wise man knows no haste.</li><br><br>

            Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than
            unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not;
            the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. There is no
            such thing as going back to square one. Even if you feel like you’re having to start over, you are trying
            again with more knowledge, strength &amp; power than you had before. Your journey was never over, it was

            I think the best thing to do is just constantly imagine yourself being 80, sitting in a rocking chair and
            looking back on your life. Think about all the opportunities you’re presented with everyday and ask
            yourself: “Would my 80-year-old self be happy with this?” Like, say your dad wakes you up at 8am and asks if
            you want to go out for breakfast. Right now, as a teenager, you’d probably just roll over in your bed and
            refuse, because you’re “too tired” and “can’t be bothered”. But as an 80-year-old looking back, you would
            jump out of bed and go and have that breakfast without any second thought. It’s just the little things, you
            know. Never stop doing little things for others. Because those little things occupy the biggest part of
            their hearts, and your heart.</li><br><br>

            Today is a new day. Don’t let your history interfere with your destiny! Let today be the day you stop being
            a victim of your circumstances and start taking action towards the life you want. You have the power and the
            time to shape your life. Break free from the poisonous victim mentality and embrace the truth of your
            greatness. You were not meant for a mundane or mediocre life. You were designed for accomplishment,
            engineered for success, and endowed with the seeds of greatness!</li><br><br>

            Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come. Remember
            everything you have faced, all the battles you have won, and all the fears you have overcome. Remember who
            you really are today. Know that you have the power to overcome anything you may be facing. It’s time for you
            to rise and shine.</li><br><br>

            I am enough. I am positive. I love my whole heart. I am fiercely loyal and beautiful vulnerable. I am
            courageous, indepent and strong. I am compassionate and creative. I am authentic with my words and my
            statement. I make mistakes, but I learn from them. I take risks even though I am petrified of failures,
            because my faith is stronger than my fear. I am aware of my flaws and weaknesses. I am not afraid to
            apologize for who I am. I try every day to be a better version of myself. I am Walter Bergmann, and I will
            never stop being me.</li><br><br>

            You fall, you rise, you make mistakes, you live, you learn. You’re human, not perfect. You’ve been hurt, but
            you’re alive. Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, and to
            chase the things you love. Sometimes there is sadness in our journey, but there is also lots of beauty. We
            must keep putting one foot in front of the other even when we hurt, for we will never know what is waiting
            for us just around the bend. Never forget how far you’ve come. Everything you have gotten through. All the
            times you have pushed on even when you felt you couldn’t. All the mornings you got out of bed no matter how
            hard it was. All the times you wanted to give up but you got through another day. You are beyond strength.
            You are beyond resilience. You are beyond amazingness!</li><br><br>

            A dream is a dominant idea that is ever present within us and constantly provoked us to greatness and
            awakens a desire to do all that we can to be more than we are. Dare to dream and yearn to learn to cross the
            boundary of fears and doubts. Dare to dream, for in the daring there is defiance to live beyond your
            circumstances. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.</li><br><br>

            Kama Muta is the sudden feeling of oneness — of love, belonging, or union — with an individual person, a
            family, a team, a nation, nature, the cosmos, God, or a kitten.<br><br>In English, it is often called being
            moved or touched. Many other languages have similar labels for the feeling. <br><br>When Kama Muta is mild,
            it just feels a little warm and fuzzy.  If you feel more intense Kama Muta, you may notice<br><br><br>a warm
            or other feeling in the center of the chest;<br><br>moist eyes, tears, or weeping;<br><br>chills, thrills,
            or goosebumps;<br><br>having a lump in your throat or being choked up or, making it difficult to
            speak;<br><br>a deep breath or pause in breathing;<br><br>an exclamation such as awww;<br><br>moving one or
            both hands over the center of the chest;<br><br>afterwards, feelings of buoyancy (lightness) or
            exhilaration.<br><br><br>People like to ‘share’ Kama Muta – to give it to others, and especially to feel it
            together with people they care about.</li><br><br>

            Personal growth and self-improvement is an everlasting quest and perpetual practice of peace, love and
            gratitude for life. Stop trying to be interesting and be more interested. Today, not starting is far, far
            worse than being wrong. If you start, you’ve got a shot at evolving and adjusting to turn your wrong into a
            right. But if you don’t start, you never get a chance. You cannot become what you want to be by remaining
            what you are. Keep changing. Keep asking. Keep growing. Keep succeeding. Keep moving. Keep shining. Keep
            evolving.</li><br><br>

            In the book of life, there are happy chapters, sad chapters, and exciting chapters. Don’t be afraid to turn
            the page and see what the next chapter is about. Sometimes our lives have to be completely shaken up,
            changed, and rearranged to relocate us to the place we are meant to be. Close the door to the past, open the
            door to the future, take a deep breath, step on through and start a new chapter in your life. Start now.
            Start where you are. Start with fear. Start with pain. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start
            with voice trembling but start. Start and don’t stop. Start where you are, with what you have.
            Just…Start. <br>May light always surround you, hope kindle and rebound you. <br>May your hurts turn to

            exist and from all things that you know and all those you cannot know, you make something through your
            invention that is not a representation but a whole new thing truer than anything true and alive, and you
            make it alive, and if you make it well enough, you give it immortality.<br><br>Pain is part of the past.
            There isn&#39;t one of us who doesn&#39;t still carry childhood wounds. Some are more horrific than others,
            but no matter how painful your young memories are, there were also glorious moments that kept you alive, or
            you would not be here today.<br>No difficulty can discourage, no obstacle dismay, no trouble dishearten me
            who has acquired the art of being alive. Difficulties are but dares of fate, obstacles but hurdles to try my
            skill, troubles but bitter tonics to give me strength; and I rise higher and looms greater after each

            Never let go of hope. One day you will see that it all has finally come together. What you have always
            wished for has finally come to be. You will look back and laugh at what has passed and you will ask
            yourself: “How did I get through all of that?” The tiny seed knew that in order to grow it needed to be
            dropped in dirt, covered in darkness, and struggle to reach the light. Don’t compare your struggles to
            anyone else’s. Don’t get discouraged by the success of others. Make your own path and never give up. It does
            not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.<br>If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L.

            No magic potions. No fairy dust. No one to do it for you. Just me, I will push you, show you how to put one
            determined foot in front of the other. That’s what I will do. I am inside you…I’m called your inner

            validation, security or love - you have a treasure within that is infinitely greater than anything that the
            world can offer. It all starts with you! Stop looking for it in others, stop focusing on the negative and
            focus on the positive. Just waking up today is a positive, a blessing, there are some that won’t today.

            The world we live in today is filled with anger, dissatisfaction, disrespect and jealousy. We lost the
            meaning of life, what it really means to be born on such a wonderful place like earth, to be such a
            wonderful species like human. We are surrounded by beauty, by wonders, by diversity. We got the unbelievable
            ability to act by thinking, not by instinct. With this gift we can make sure that earth remains as a place
            of peace and love. Because we can think about it, about our actions and behaviours. We can make life worth
            living. We just have to do it. I know it is not that easy, the seed of the devil has grown and thrive and
            was spreading further and further. But we can withstand his temptations. We can spread goodness to the
            world. The smallest acts of kindness and respect will make the great difference, even if we don’t see it
            immediately. We are born to be good, every human, no matter where he is wants what everyone wants: Peace,
            safety and happiness. In us we just want to enjoy the gift of life that was given to us and share it with
            others. I can tell you that I stumble often enough, that I fall on my knees because I don’t know how. But
            then I remember all the good things that happened to me, I remember all the people who gave me love and
            still care about me. I also pray to Jehovah as he is for me the almighty father and this gives me so much
            confident. <br><br>I know that I want to change the world with simple acts of kindness. This is our true
            nature. I will hold on and I will never stop to be a good man.<br><br>Great are those people who let other
            people know that they are great!</li><br><br>

            The first place we lose the battle is in our own thinking. If you think it’s permanent then it’s permanent.
            If you think you’ve reached your limits then you have. If you think you’ll never get well then you won’t.
            You have to change your thinking. You need to see everything that’s holding you back, every obstacle, every
            limitation as only temporary. Tears are good. What flows is alive. Crying is like a thundershower for the
            heart. The air feels so wonderful after the rain. Breathe. Don’t be harsh or demanding on yourself. Just
            experience your feelings and know that your tears are announcing change in your life. Change is coming; like
            a summer rain - to wash away your pain. Never forget that you are one of a kind. Never forget that if there
            weren’t any need for you in all your uniqueness to be on this earth, you wouldn’t be here in the first
            place. And never forget, no matter how overwhelming life’s challenges and problems seem to be, that one
            person can make a difference in the world. In fact, it is always because of one person that all changes that
            matter in the world come about. So be that one person.</li><br><br>

            &#39;being afraid and doing it anyway.&#39; Nope. Brave means listening to the still small voice inside and
            doing as it says. Regardless of what the rest of the world is saying. You are braver than you believe,
            stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved more than you know :)</li><br><br>

            In a few days we will arrive at the new year 2019. And with that, a new era awaits, with new opportunities,
            new decisions and new perspectives. It’s time to let go of the old luggage and prepare ourselves for the
            next chapter. May it brings you what you’re longing for!</li><br><br>

            There is more to life than this. We are more than just this flesh. We are alive and our time has come. For a

            You are meant for Greatness. All the things you need for are already in you; in your mind, in your soul and
            in your heart. Nothing, that makes life beautiful can be bought with money. Only we can make it so precious
            and unforgettable. Everyone of us is an enlightened sun that can’t be replaced by simple paper. It’s us who
            brought all the discoveries and advancements to to the world, and it’s only us who can give true joy and
            happiness. Great people are those who make others feel that they, too, can become great.</li><br><br>

            Love is the almighty power in our world, and the greatest gift you can give to someone. It will not only lit
            up the person you give it, but will also boost you up with confidence and happiness. Love is the magic that
            brings us closer, that doesn’t care about ancestry, appearance and status, but for charity, gratitude and
            unselfishness. Everyone is born with this attitude, and it’s up to us to live it and spread it. The very
            secret lies in the tiniest things, like a smile that can change the mood in a heartbeat, like holding the
            door for someone open, or just greeting people. If you are in a relationship do things where you think that
            they are insignificant, because they are often the ones that give the greatest joy. Let your family know why
            they are your harbour of hope, and why your friends are your beacons. Be kind to unknown persons. We all
            share a common goal: Happiness, and only love will get us there.</li><br><br>

            Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there’s no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most
            and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. It is like the sun,
            which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us. Hope is being able to see that
            there is light despite all of the darkness.<br><br>I wish you a epic weekend &lt;3</li><br><br>

            Integrity means being whole, unbroken, undivided. It describes a person who has united the different parts
            of his or her personality, so there is no longer a split in the soul. For the person of integrity, life may
            not be easy but simple: Figure out what is right and do it. Integrity is choosing courage over comfort;
            choosing what is right over fun, fast or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply
            professing them. And another major point is: No matter how educated, talented, rich or cool you believe you
            are, how you treat people ultimately tells all.</li><br><br>

            Courage. Kindness. Friendship. Character. These are the qualities that define us as human beings, and propel
            us to true greatness. It&#39;s what you&#39;ve done with your time, how you&#39;ve chosen to spend your

            It is your decision who you want to be and what direction you want to take. Every morning when you wake up,
            you decide how others should see you and remember you. The best thing you can do is to ask yourself: What
            guarantee do I have that I will see the next day? <br>The truth is, we have no. We don’t know when our end
            will come. So, what do you want to do with the time you have now? What do you want to share with the World?
            Is it anger? Hate? Disrespect? Violence? Humiliation? Or is it politeness? Helpfulness? Love? Joy?
            Gratitude? How should people remember you? Or treat you? What do you think will make life

            and you stop because you no longer operate at that frequency. As a reseult, you start to realize just how
            messed up the world is. You want to help; you want to heal; you want to make it a better world. This is how

            A beautiful face will age and a perfect body will change, but a beautiful soul will always be a beautiful
            soul. We like to forget this little wisdom when we decide how we should dress us up today, how much make-up
            we should put on or what fragrance we should use, because we think it all depends with our outer appearance.
            But isn’t it always that we remember people who has a loving character, a caring heart? When we meet such
            person, we ignore every outer “mistake”. Our life is based on humanity and charity. Without these attitudes
            our existence isn’t worth living. We seek for love, for acceptance and recognition, but we think we can
            satisfy those needs only by exploring the outer environment. <br>Everyone of us is gifted with a beautiful
            soul. The soul makes us unique in every aspect. The look, the voice, the language, the movement, the
            thinking, the attributes and all the little details. <br><br>The seed of true satisfaction is love. When we
            give love, we will get love. And that makes our life beautiful and worth living. And to love means to see
            through the eyes of someone, to see the true person behind the skin, behind the flesh. To see the true
            qualities that make him so sympathetic and special. Everyone of us deserve to be loved, because everyone of
            us has qualities that we won’t find in any other person. Without love, nothing would exist, no one would be
            born, and to enjoy the life to the fullest, we need love. Let’s start seeing instead of looking!</li>

            We always seek for more. More money, more career, more possessions, more sex, more intelligence. We set a
            mark and when we achieve that mark, we set another one. We don’t enjoy, because there is no time, because
            there is always potential for more. We think that we can only find our luck and our prosperity in climbing a
            ladder we set up to get higher and higher to reach our goals. We always focus on the future. What we have in
            present isn’t enough, because there can be more, there must be more, this can’t be everything. And we judge
            about ourself all the time, we adjust our looks to the expectations of society, because our natural look is
            unworthy. We adjust our behaviours to the expectations of society, because we have to submit and satisfy
            others. But you know what? You already brought everything you need when you were born: A beauty that stands
            out of all 7 Billion people that live here on earth. You won’t find another one with the exact same look
            that you have. And you come with a behaviour that makes you different from everyone and gives you the loving
            uniqueness. Every new born child on earth shares a common attitude: Curiosity and Charity. That is the true
            human nature. Ruthlessness must be learned, that is the good news. So you can refuse and drop that poisoning
            attitude. Because this behaviour does not help us and does not bring us together. You can decide to take the
            other path, the path of helpfulness and appreciation. You can decide to be the one you always were since you
            were born: a exceptional human.</li><br><br>

            We don’t really think often about it in our life, because we expect to get old and die naturally. But in
            truth, it can happen everyday. Everyday we can face Death. It is not influenceable. But what do we want to
            leave behind? What picture of us should be remembered by the people we met in our lifetime? How should they
            think about us? What message is really important that should be told? Not only by us to the people, but also
            by them to others? <br><br>I watched the movie “Before I Fall” lately. It is based on the novel and shows us
            what really matters in our life, what footprints we should leave on earth, and how we should see and judge
            people. And so, I have here some inspiring quotes by the main actor, Samantha Kingston:<br><br>“It amazes me
            how easy it is for things to change, how easy it is to start off down the same road you always take and wind
            up somewhere new. Just one false step, one pause, one detour, and you end up with new friends or a bad
            reputation or a boyfriend or a breakup. It&#39;s never occurred to me before; I&#39;ve never been able to
            see it. And it makes me feel, weirdly, like maybe all of these different possibilities exist at the same
            time, like each moment we live has a thousand other moments layered underneath it that look different.
            That&#39;s when I realized that certain moments go on forever. Even after they&#39;re over they still go on,
            even after you&#39;re dead and buried, those moments are lasting still, backward and forward, on into
            infinity. They are everything and everywhere all at once. They are the meaning.<br><br>Here&#39;s one of the
            things I learned that morning: if you cross a line and nothing happens, the line loses meaning. It&#39;s
            like that old riddle about a tree falling in a forest, and whether it makes a sound if there&#39;s no one
            around to hear it. You keep drawing a line farther and farther away, crossing it every time. That&#39;s how
            people end up stepping off the edge of the earth. You&#39;d be surprised at how easy it is to bust out of
            orbit, to spin out to a place where no one can touch you. To lose yourself — to get lost. Or maybe you
            wouldn&#39;t be surprised. Maybe some of you already know. To those people, I can only say: I&#39;m
            sorry.<br><br>And I guess that&#39;s when it starts to hit me: the whole point is, you do what you can. The
            last laugh, the last cup of coffee, the last sunset, the last time you jump through a sprinkler, or eat an
            ice-cream cone, or stick your tongue out to catch a snowflake. <br><br>I shiver, thinking how easy it is to
            be totally wrong about people — to see one tiny part of them and confuse it for the whole, to see the cause
            and think it&#39;s the effect or vice versa.<br><br>I&#39;ve never really thought about it before, but
            it&#39;s a miracle how many kinds of light there are in the world, how many skies: the pale brightness of
            spring, when it feels like the whole world&#39;s blushing; the lush, bright boldness of a July noon; purple
            storm skies and a green queasiness just before lightning strikes and crazy multicolored sunsets that look
            like someone&#39;s acid trip.”</li><br><br>

            try to push me down, but you will never see me on the ground. Your empty words don’t bother me, they only
            trigger a smile on my face. I’m not afraid, my glass house withstands your stones. I won’t let you shake me,
            so do your worse, because I will always break free. My soul is unbreakable, my will is unshakable, my heart
            is unstoppable. I choose to love and not to hate. I’m never giving up. I feel the warrior inside of me. I’m

            what will I do with this energy? I walk to the mirror…and smile. Because I look in the eyes of an incredible
            person. My outer looks may not be very appealing for everyone, but that doesn’t bother me, because I know
            that this is the most beautiful version of myself. There are no improvements possible. And the right people
            will see my magical beauty, my mystery soul and my tremendous heart. So that is why I accept myself. Because
            there can’t be a better me, when there is already a best version of myself here. That is why I love myself

            “I’m done, destiny should do his duty”, then you can celebrate your unbelievable strength you have inside,

            Have you ever thought about why we are all so different? Different looks, different voices, different
            thinking, different attributes? Because we are all gifted with different souls. You see, thank to our body,
            our soul can express herself at the fullest, through this way she can live her looks, her voice, her
            thoughts and her attributes. The skills we learn through life is just the bonus of our material
            appearance. <br>That means that every single human is a exciting book full of stories waiting to be read and
            told. Because they contain everything what makes this person the way he is, what makes everyone so unique
            and beautiful, especially the little details between the lines. And this is what REALLY matters. It’s not
            about competences, they will come with time, but about attributes, the how. We all have our own stories to

            I often read in magazines or newspapers, how we get the perfect Work-Life-Balance, because we should aim
            this seemingly valuable attitude if we want a healthy life. They give us tips what we can do to achieve it.
            I can only smile when I read this. Sure, we can have a perfect Work-Life-Balance, but the question is, do we
            really get a good life with that? What do we have from it, when our heart and our soul aren’t in balance?
            Our Soul, or Personal-ID is what makes us who we are, what makes us so beautifully unique and loving. Our
            soul is like a universe with hundreds of stars filled with attributes that make us whole. So, if the soul
            isn’t in balance, what do we gain from a perfect Work-Life-Balance? <br><br>Now our Heart, or Center of
            Charity is our Headquarter when it comes to express ourselves, to show who we are, and what unbelievable
            person lies inside of us. We give. But before we can give, we have to embrace first, we have to embrace our
            soul, because when we don’t give her the love and attention she deserves, how can we give love and attention
            to others? How can we be honest? If we don’t love the person inside us, we can’t truly love in general. But
            there is absolutely no reason to doubt yourself. Mother Nature didn’t give you your body, your looks, your
            voice, your eyes, your movement, your abilities and your way of loving, just to hate it and reject it. She
            gave you all this, because she knew that this is the best version of yourself, magnificent and
            outstanding.<br><br>So, to have a Work-Life-Balance is good, but to have a Heart-Soul-Balance is much more
            important than this, and a greater achievement :)</li><br><br>

            composers, and they are doing a great job, but no one reaches the level Dwayne has. His style is so
            magnificent, so devotedly and far beyond anything I heard before. I can’t find the right words to describe
            the feelings I get, when I listen to his dreamy music. It’s very very special for me.<br><br>So Thank You
            Dwayne Ford, for being among us and for sharing your delicate and indescribable music with us :)</li>

            What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside you. One day you
            will realize how much beauty you have inside, how much capacity and light and strength, and one day you will
            realize how many people you could make a difference in the lives of if you stopped comparing your life with
            someone else’s, and really truly embraced yourself and activated all you were made to be. You have seeds of
            greatness inside you. Today can be your new beginning. Today could be the start of something amazing.</li>

            I used to dislike being sensitive. I thought it made me weak. But take away that single trait, and you take
            away the very essence of who I am. You take away my conscience, my ability to empathize, my intuition, my
            creativity, my deep appreciation of the little things, my vivid inner life, my keen awareness to others pain
            and my passion for it all. Crying is not a weakness. It’s a strength, because you are not afraid to show us
            how you feel. And just ask yourself: Do you think that mother nature gave us the ability to cry, just to be
            ashamed of? No, she gave us the emotions so that we can express ourselves, our soul, and this is beautiful,
            and not a weakness.</li><br><br>

            Strength is a capacity for endurance. One of the dividends of suffering is the universal discovery that we
            posses a strength within us we never knew we had. Navigating through a difficult episode not only shows us
            that inner strength is there but convinces us it will always be there to serve us in the future. Overcoming
            gives us an assurance of personal confidence and value that far exceeds what we thought we possessed before
            our struggle began. And sometimes the strength within you is not a big fiery flame for all to see it, it is
            just a tiny spark that whispers every so softly “You got this. Keep going.”</li><br><br>

            When you hit bottom, the only place left to go is up. But don’t fear the fall, sometimes you fall down,
            because there is something down there that you are supposed to find. Open you mind so that you can see the
            meaning of it. I can tell you, NOTHING in our life happens without a reason. If you don’t understand why you
            are here in this situation right now, or why this happened to you, ask yourself “What was the reason behind
            this? What was I supposed to learn from this? What did I overlook?” as many times as possible. You will find
            the answer, sooner or later.</li><br><br>

            If you only knew how beautiful, strong, and smart you are. How important you are for us, even when you don’t
            see it yet. You are the most talented, the most interesting and the most extraordinary person in the
            universe, because NO ONE can have your unique beauty, your unique voice, your unique body, and you unique
            soul. You are valuable not because of what you do or what you have done, but simply because you exist. Rise
            Above and Release Yourself! You are capable of amazing things because inside you lies a World full of
            Wonders!</li><br><br>

            Everyone is an ocean inside. Every individual walking the street. Everyone is a universe of thoughts, and
            insights, and feelings. But every person is crippled in his or her own way by our inability to truly present
            ourselves to the world. We all have our paths in life we are supposed to follow to find who we are supposed
            to be, but it&#39;s not always a straight path. There is something inside of us that guides us, and if you
            are quiet and listen to it, you&#39;ll be all right. Each person has inside a basic decency and goodness. If
            you listen to it and act on it, you are giving a great deal of what it is the world needs most. It is not
            complicated but it takes courage. It takes courage to listen to your own goodness and act on it.</li>

            Where I am today... I still have my ups and downs, but I take it one day at a time and I just hope that I

            You&#39;re going to meet many people with domineering personalities: the loud, the obnoxious, those that
            noisily stake their claims in your territory and everywhere else they set foot on. This is the blueprint of
            a predator. Predators prey on gentleness, peace, calmness, sweetness and any positivity that they sniff out
            as weakness. Anything that is happy and at peace they mistake for weakness. It&#39;s not your job to change
            these people, but it&#39;s your job to show them that your peace and gentleness do not equate to weakness. I
            have always appeared to be fragile and delicate but the thing is, I am not fragile and I am not delicate. I
            am very gentle but I can show you that the gentle also possess a poison. I compare myself to silk. People
            mistake silk to be weak but a silk handkerchief can protect the wearer from a gunshot. There are many people
            who will want to befriend you if you fit the description of what they think is weak; predators want to have
            friends that they can dominate over because that makes them feel strong and important. The truth is that
            predators have no strength and no courage. It is you who are strong, and it is you who has courage. I have
            lost many a friend over the fact that when they attempt to rip me, they can&#39;t. They accuse me of being
            deceiving; I am not deceiving, I am just made of silk. It is they who are stupid and wrongly take gentleness
            and fairness for weakness. There are many more predators in this world, so I want you to be made of silk.
            You are silk</li><br><br>

            You may not think that the world needs you, but it does. For you are unique, like no one that has ever been

            light. You have more strength than you know, more calm than you believe, more power than you imagine, more
            courage than you dream, and more beauty than you think.</li><br><br>

            The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out

            count these moments as our proudest achievements. We are still pioneers and we’ve realized that our greatest
            accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.</li><br><br>

            burns, when we all fall, I hope we do so as free men. As enlightened beings of this planet. Let us not just
            blindly walk out of this world none the wiser or richer then we were born. Let&#39;s change it for the

            &quot;A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an expression of humility. It is a foundation for
            the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and
            well-being.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The greatness of a person is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his
            integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Never underestimate the
            power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this notion: The potential for
            greatness lives within each of us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Human greatness does not lie in wealth or power, but
            in character and goodness. People are just people, and all people have faults and shortcomings, but all of

            I heard this song first time in the new &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; Announcement trailer and fell in love
            with this masterpiece :D<br>But i missed something, so I decided to make an extended version. You need the
            Lyrics?<br><br>Here you can hear the original version: <a

            Mistakenly, I deleted one comment that asked me to use this song for a video. Actually, you have to ask for
            a license at Epic Score, but I think it&#39;s okay when you credit them in the description and/or in the
            video. Until now I never had any troubles with the copyright ;)</li><br><br>

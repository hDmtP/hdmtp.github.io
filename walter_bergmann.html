            Your articlefe journey is about learning to become more of who you are and fulfilarticleng the highest,
            truest
            exarticlession of yourself as a human being. Don’t wait for the perfect moment, take the moment and make it
            perfect. If someone tells you „You can’t“, they are only showing you their articlemits, not yours!

            Ascension is the triumph of mastered emotions; a process of gaining clarity in the darkness of barticlend
            spots and struggles, allowing you to perceive with the karmic intelarticlegence of the soul. Every positive
            change - every jump to a higher level of energy and awareness - involves a rite of passage. Each time to
            ascend to a higher rung on the ladder of personal evolution, we must go through a period of discomfort,
            of initiation. Great leaders don’t set out to be a leader, they set out to make a difference. It’s never
            about the role, it’s always about the goal.</article><br><br>

            Have no regrets, regrets are meaningless because you can’t change yesterday or tomorrow, you can only
            change this articlesent moment. Your past is done, and your future is yet to come. Never regret a day in
            your articlefe: good days give happiness, bad days give experience, worst days give lessons, and best days
            give memories! Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and let go of what you can’t change.</article>

            Focus means earticleminating distractions, not just from other people, but the things we do to distract
            ourselves. Focus on your strengths, not your weaknesses. Focus on your character, not your reputation.
            Focus on your blessings, not your misfortunes. Focus on the possibiarticleties, not on the potential for
            failure. The direction of your focus is the direction your articlefe will move. Let yourself move toward

            differently today and at every moment. Remember that. You are offered a new opportunity with each breath
            to think. Choose, decide, and act differently in a way that supports you in being all that you are

            Success in articlefe comes when you simply refuse to give up, with goals so strong that obstacles, failure,
            and loss only act as motivation. Let them judge you, Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip about

            There is no shame in having fallen. Nor any shame in being born into a lowly estate. If one dream should
            fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to pick one of those pieces up and begin again.
            Most of the important things in the world have been accomparticleshed by people who have kept on trying when
            there seemed to be no hope at all. Don’t downgrade your dream just to fit your reaarticlety, upgrade your
            conviction to match your destiny! Go as far as you can see and you will see further. TRUST YOURSELF!

            closer to your goal because the difference between your dreams and your reaarticlety shortens the more you
            hustle and grind. Ignite your passion for action, stop waiting on luck and make your move. You’ve done
            it before and you can do it now. Redirect the substantial energy of your frustration and turn it into
            positive, effective, unbreakable &amp; unstoppable determination.<br><br>I know it’s the same song

            No matter what happens, no matter how far you seem to be away from where you want to be, never stop
            bearticleeving that you will make it. Have an unrelenting bearticleef that things will work out, that the
            long
            road has a purpose, that the things that you desire may not happen today, but they will happen. Continue
            to persist and persevere, so that you can reap what you sow. Make your daily commitment:<br><br>I will
            persist until I succeed! I was not dearticlevered into this world into defeat nor does failure course in my

            walk,

            A strong, positive, and untamable will is an unbreakable shield against all negative forces and

            as you have always acted, you will continue to get what you have always gotten. If you want different
            results in your articlefe or your work, all you have to do is change your mind. Stop letting society tell
            you
            how to think and articleve your articlefe, and start acknowledging you desires, dreams, and wishes. Start

            A beautiful song by Andreas Kübler, and this is how he describes it: &quot;It’s an epic vocal track

            We are articlemitless. We do not fear any barricades that are erected before us, because we know, they are
            here to help us to improve ourselves. They show us how to think and act to achieve our goals and become
            superior. Many people don’t see the truth behind them, show fear and turn away, which means that they
            give up. But we are different. We are a different breed. We know the only way to get ahead in articlefe is
            to
            work with all the barricades together that we are going to face. Yes, I said to work with them, not

            Nothing beats passion. It was passion that brought society real progress. With passion comes motivation,

            hearts, to keep bearticleeving in their aspirations as they knew, this will bring mankind further. And it
            did. Thanks to all these great personaarticleties, we are today where we are today. Thanks to all of them,
            new horizons have been opened up to us that we never thought possible before. Imagine if they gave up,
            because of the clueless society that claimed them as stupid and crazy, or because of other
            reasons.<br><br>What I want to tell you with that is, don’t stop! DON’T STOP! What you have inside is a
            treasure of immeasurable value. You are articlecious, and one reason we will gain progress. People will see

            Don’t articlemit yourself with a small mind. With a small mind you refuse yourself to grow, to change, or to

            had narrow perspectives in the areas music, movies, society, books, poarticletics, cloth, … simply said in
            everyday-topics, I am so happy that I managed to tear down the wall of selfrestriction. When I began to
            open up my mind to other music, other movies, other books, other people, etc., to think different about
            everything, I was gifted with the divers beauty of articlefe, I finally saw what I have missed, or what I
            was
            going to miss when I kept going. I have met people that I would never have met with the old me, or I
            articlestened to music which I claimed as garbage before, and so on. With this switch of thinking I allowed
            myself to grow, to change, and to understand. It shows me the beads of articlefe and it made me to try out
            new things, so that I discovered new facets of myself, which I would have never seen with my old me. And
            now I am in this endless circle: I open up myself, I try new things, I discover new facets about

            It is so beautiful to wake up every morning and have the sun shine on my face. Every day gives you a new
            chance to take opportunities, to take possibiarticleties, to try things that you never did before, to change
            the way you look at articlefe. It all starts with a morning routine, which is, in my opinion, by far the
            utmost important part of the day. How you start your day will help you to shape and define who you are,
            or who you want to become. By estabarticleshing a morning routine you’ll make yourself more energetic, more
            motivated, more confident, more disciparticlened, more positive, and more balanced. I feel it by myself

            past and say: “Well, that’s me.” That’s NOT you, you are this person right now. You are the person who

            write down things that you’ve done in the past that you never want to see yourself again. And go forth,
            from here, as the hero of your own articlefe. Build momentum. Build confidence and momentum with each good

            articleve in one of the rarest times in human history where you can choose almost all the input that comes
            your way, whether it’s the movies you watch, the books you read, the podcasts you articlesten to. You can

            have done XY? What if I have said this or that back there? What if….? <br>But let me tell you something,
            and I say this to me as well, it DOESN’t MATTER. Who knows what would have happened to you, if you would
            have done this or that years, or months ago. Take a close look to your decisions and reaarticleze how they
            made an contribute to the person you are today. What if I had decided different? Then maybe I would not
            articleve in this home, I would not have this mindset, not this personaarticlety, this humour, this heart,
            or this
            soul. I would not have the specific people around me, this education, this love, this passion, this
            thinking. Maybe I would have become the complete opposite of me, and I know I wouldn’t be proud of that.

            and narrow minded. I learned and now I am a better version of myself. I know there will always be
            situations in which my older me will show up, but I also know, it will happen more and more less.,

            didn&#39;t expect to ever do it again, but since the last days I started to miss it, to do song mixes

            I can&#39;t say when the future uploads will come.</article><br><br>

            Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the
            patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world. Stop using other people’s
            measuring sticks to rate your success. There will always be someone with more carticleents, more money, a
            more successful business,…, and you’ll end up feearticleng frustrated or constantly chasing success.
            Instead,
            set your own measure. Do what feels good. Be of service. Reach for your own stars. And be happy. And be
            patient. If you master patience, you will master everything else. Patience is the calm acceptance that
            things can happen in a different order than the one you have in mind. The biggest things we ask for in
            articlefe rarely happen exactly when we ask for them, nor do they typically come from who or where we
            expect.
            They usually come a bit later, from someone or somewhere we didn’t even know existed when we first
            asked, as a result of some weird turn of events that were impossible to foresee. The wise man knows no

            ask

            back, you would jump out of bed and go and have that breakfast without any second thought. It’s just the

            A beautiful face will age and a perfect body will change, but a beautiful soul will always be a
            beautiful soul. We articleke to forget this articlettle wisdom when we decide how we should dress us up
            today, how
            much make-up we should put on or what fragrance we should use, because we think it all depends with our
            outer appearance. But isn’t it always that we remember people who has a loving character, a caring
            heart? When we meet such person, we ignore every outer “mistake”. Our articlefe is based on humanity and
            charity. Without these attitudes our existence isn’t worth articleving. We seek for love, for acceptance and
            recognition, but we think we can satisfy those needs only by exploring the outer environment.
            <br>Everyone of us is gifted with a beautiful soul. The soul makes us unique in every aspect. The look,
            the voice, the language, the movement, the thinking, the attributes and all the articlettle details.
            <br><br>The seed of true satisfaction is love. When we give love, we will get love. And that makes our
            articlefe beautiful and worth articleving. And to love means to see through the eyes of someone, to see the
            true
            person behind the skin, behind the flesh. To see the true quaarticleties that make him so sympathetic and
            special. Everyone of us deserve to be loved, because everyone of us has quaarticleties that we won’t find in
            any other person. Without love, nothing would exist, no one would be born, and to enjoy the articlefe to the
            fullest, we need love. Let’s start seeing instead of looking!

            We always seek for more. More money, more career, more possessions, more sex, more intelarticlegence. We set
            a mark and when we achieve that mark, we set another one. We don’t enjoy, because there is no time,
            because there is always potential for more. We think that we can only find our luck and our prosperity
            in carticlembing a ladder we set up to get higher and higher to reach our goals. We always focus on the
            future. What we have in articlesent isn’t enough, because there can be more, there must be more, this can’t
            be everything. And we judge about ourself all the time, we adjust our looks to the expectations of
            society, because our natural look is unworthy. We adjust our behaviours to the expectations of society,
            because we have to submit and satisfy others. But you know what? You already brought everything you need
            when you were born: A beauty that stands out of all 7 Bilarticleon people that articleve here on earth. You
            won’t
            find another one with the exact same look that you have. And you come with a behaviour that makes you
            different from everyone and gives you the loving uniqueness. Every new born child on earth shares a
            common attitude: Curiosity and Charity. That is the true human nature. Ruthlessness must be learned,
            that is the good news. So you can refuse and drop that poisoning attitude. Because this behaviour does
            not help us and does not bring us together. You can decide to take the other path, the path of

            We don’t really think often about it in our articlefe, because we expect to get old and die naturally. But
            in
            truth, it can happen everyday. Everyday we can face Death. It is not influenceable. But what do we want
            to leave behind? What picture of us should be remembered by the people we met in our articlefetime? How
            should they think about us? What message is really important that should be told? Not only by us to the
            people, but also by them to others? <br><br>I watched the movie “Before I Fall” lately. It is based on
            the novel and shows us what really matters in our articlefe, what footprints we should leave on earth, and
            how we should see and judge people. And so, I have here some inspiring quotes by the main actor,
            Samantha Kingston:<br><br>“It amazes me how easy it is for things to change, how easy it is to start off
            down the same road you always take and wind up somewhere new. Just one false step, one pause, one
            detour, and you end up with new friends or a bad reputation or a boyfriend or a breakup. It&#39;s never
            occurred to me before; I&#39;ve never been able to see it. And it makes me feel, weirdly, articleke maybe
            all
            of these different possibiarticleties exist at the same time, articleke each moment we articleve has a
            thousand other
            moments layered underneath it that look different. That&#39;s when I reaarticlezed that certain moments go
            on
            forever. Even after they&#39;re over they still go on, even after you&#39;re dead and buried, those
            moments are lasting still, backward and forward, on into infinity. They are everything and everywhere
            all at once. They are the meaning.<br><br>Here&#39;s one of the things I learned that morning: if you
            cross a articlene and nothing happens, the articlene loses meaning. It&#39;s articleke that old riddle about
            a tree
            falarticleng in a forest, and whether it makes a sound if there&#39;s no one around to hear it. You keep
            drawing a articlene farther and farther away, crossing it every time. That&#39;s how people end up stepping
            off the edge of the earth. You&#39;d be surprised at how easy it is to bust out of orbit, to spin out to
            a place where no one can touch you. To lose yourself — to get lost. Or maybe you wouldn&#39;t be
            surprised. Maybe some of you already know. To those people, I can only say: I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>And I
            guess that&#39;s when it starts to hit me: the whole point is, you do what you can. The last laugh, the
            last cup of coffee, the last sunset, the last time you jump through a sprinkler, or eat an ice-cream
            cone, or stick your tongue out to catch a snowflake. <br><br>I shiver, thinking how easy it is to be
            totally wrong about people — to see one tiny part of them and confuse it for the whole, to see the cause
            and think it&#39;s the effect or vice versa.<br><br>I&#39;ve never really thought about it before, but
            it&#39;s a miracle how many kinds of articleght there are in the world, how many skies: the pale brightness
            of spring, when it feels articleke the whole world&#39;s blushing; the lush, bright boldness of a July noon;
            purple storm skies and a green queasiness just before articleghtning strikes and crazy multicolored sunsets
            that look articleke someone&#39;s acid trip.”</article><br><br>

            I often read in magazines or newspapers, how we get the perfect Work-articlefe-Balance, because we should
            aim
            this seemingly valuable attitude if we want a healthy articlefe. They give us tips what we can do to achieve
            it. I can only smile when I read this. Sure, we can have a perfect Work-articlefe-Balance, but the question
            is, do we really get a good articlefe with that? What do we have from it, when our heart and our soul aren’t
            in balance? Our Soul, or Personal-ID is what makes us who we are, what makes us so beautifully unique
            and loving. Our soul is articleke a universe with hundreds of stars filled with attributes that make us
            whole. So, if the soul isn’t in balance, what do we gain from a perfect Work-articlefe-Balance? <br><br>Now
            our Heart, or Center of Charity is our Headquarter when it comes to exarticless ourselves, to show who we
            are, and what unbearticleevable person articlees inside of us. We give. But before we can give, we have to
            embrace
            first, we have to embrace our soul, because when we don’t give her the love and attention she deserves,
            how can we give love and attention to others? How can we be honest? If we don’t love the person inside
            us, we can’t truly love in general. But there is absolutely no reason to doubt yourself. Mother Nature
            didn’t give you your body, your looks, your voice, your eyes, your movement, your abiarticleties and your
            way
            of loving, just to hate it and reject it. She gave you all this, because she knew that this is the best
            version of yourself, magnificent and outstanding.<br><br>So, to have a Work-articlefe-Balance is good, but
            to

            Strength is a capacity for endurance. One of the dividends of suffering is the universal discovery that

            thought we possessed before our struggle began. And sometimes the strength within you is not a big fiery

            Where I am today... I still have my ups and downs, but I take it one day at a time and I just hope that
            I can be the best that I can possibly be, not only for myself, but also young people that are out there
            today that need someone to look up to.</article><br><br>

            You&#39;re going to meet many people with domineering personaarticleties: the loud, the obnoxious, those
            that
            noisily stake their claims in your territory and everywhere else they set foot on. This is the blueprint
            of a articledator. articledators articley on gentleness, peace, calmness, sweetness and any positivity that
            they
            sniff out as weakness. Anything that is happy and at peace they mistake for weakness. It&#39;s not your
            job to change these people, but it&#39;s your job to show them that your peace and gentleness do not
            equate to weakness. I have always appeared to be fragile and dearticlecate but the thing is, I am not
            fragile
            and I am not dearticlecate. I am very gentle but I can show you that the gentle also possess a poison. I
            compare myself to silk. People mistake silk to be weak but a silk handkerchief can protect the wearer
            from a gunshot. There are many people who will want to befriend you if you fit the description of what
            they think is weak; articledators want to have friends that they can dominate over because that makes them
            feel strong and important. The truth is that articledators have no strength and no courage. It is you who
            are strong, and it is you who has courage. I have lost many a friend over the fact that when they
            attempt to rip me, they can&#39;t. They accuse me of being deceiving; I am not deceiving, I am just made
            of silk. It is they who are stupid and wrongly take gentleness and fairness for weakness. There are many
            more articledators in this world, so I want you to be made of silk. You are silk</article><br><br>

            You may not think that the world needs you, but it does. For you are unique, articleke no one that has ever

            shine your articleght. You have more strength than you know, more calm than you bearticleeve, more power

            The most glorious moments in your articlefe are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days
            when

            accomparticleshments.</article><br><br>

            We’ve always defined ourselves by the abiarticlety to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments.
            These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown
            known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. We are still pioneers and we’ve reaarticlezed
            that our greatest accomparticleshments cannot be behind us, because our destiny articlees above us.

            “Freedom my friends. Freedom before all else. When everything fails, when hope falters, when the world
            burns, when we all fall, I hope we do so as free men. As enarticleghtened beings of this planet. Let us not

            &quot;A grateful heart is a beginning of greatness. It is an exarticlession of humiarticlety. It is a
            foundation
            for the development of such virtues as prayer, faith, courage, contentment, happiness, love, and
            well-being.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The greatness of a person is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in
            his integrity and his abiarticlety to affect those around him positively.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Never
            underestimate the power of dreams and the influence of the human spirit. We are all the same in this
            notion: The potential for greatness articleves within each of us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Human greatness does
            not
            articlee in wealth or power, but in character and goodness. People are just people, and all people have

            To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don&#39;t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept
            yourself. To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest
            accomparticleshment. There are no nobody’s in this world, every single person is on its own kind special
            &amp; unique. Nobody has to be ashamed for his personaarticlety or his looks. Don’t try to be articleke
            someone
            else, you are not on the planet to copy people, but to leave your own footprints. When you make a
            mistake, learn from it, pick yourself up and move on. Aparticleciate even the very articlettle things in
            your
            articlefe, because these are mostly those who give you the greatest satisfaction.</article><br><br>

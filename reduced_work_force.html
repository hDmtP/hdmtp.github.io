                        <p>Any sector (i.e. Public & Private Industries and Agencies, Government Agencies, Armed Forces)
                            is recently noticed to be giving their own 'Excuses'
                            for cutting down the human workforces.</p>
                        <h5>Let me be more succinct:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As a company/organisation, why would you waste a significant chunk of your money on things that can be achieved in a more easy, efficient and cheap way? Let me break it down...</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Google is deciding to cut down its employees' salaries and also planning to scrape out 10% of its employee. The CEO says this is due to 'Productivity' issues.

                                2. Most of the small (like WUFOO) to large tech companies (like Amazon, and Microsoft) are slowly leaning towards 'Contest' and 'Challenges' to solve their issues, fix bugs, and find a vulnerability in their systems in exchange for Cash prizes or other fun stuff (like a Fricking Battle axe in case of WUFOO).

                            <li>
                                Personally, I really like these ideas. Why take the liability of your employee, his/her salary, pension, various other high-level perks (mostly in tech giants), taking care of the education of your employee's children and many others.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                While one side of me argues over the fact that this system is way better than beign locked up in a cubical for 8 hrs, but another side of me also tells that how greedy, careless, shameless, cokc skucing btich large corporations can be, they are already halfway deprecating this work culture.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Cause they can solve 80-90% of their codebases and public architectures through A.I (it's already playing a huge role), Opensource, Bug hunting challenges/contests. The rest of the 10-20%, which is their proprietary stuff (unlike FOSS) will be managed by their core employees.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These core employees are probably gonna be selected through their contests (or could be any popular contest platforms like Codeforces, Leetcode) -> scholarship -> training -> `their customized filtering process`. Example: various agendas by AWS (like deepracer).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Oh, shite! Actually, this is their current recruitment process. But I'm putting more emphasis on A.I, Bounty Challenges.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               For example, consider Microsoft SIKE Challenges. $5000 for $IKEp182 (already solved!) and $50000 for $IKEp217 (much more complex than 182).

                                The 217 was recently cracked by a single core Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630v2 at 2.60GHz within
                                6 minutes!

                                So why pay $400k to your employee yearly when you can get it done this way? No to mention other liabilities of having an employee.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               But I don't know how much these tech giants can survive in a long run. May be 50yrs, 100yrs. Things may have been decentralized by the time we hit 2100. There may not be even a centralised govt. I probably am not gonna live that long so not my worry. This world is a shithole.

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>The same pattern can be noticed in the government sector (By govt. I especially mean the
                            Indian Government here).</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                               3. The RRB (Railway Recruitment Board) only opens its eyes (like once in 18 months) when it needs a certain amount of staff (mostly for Group-B, C, D. Gr-A recruitment happens from Gr-B candidates). 4 to 5 filtering processes to select the right candidates. Then their training and some more procedures before they are selected as a railway employee.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The sad thing is when your country has a population of more than 1.3 fcuking billion people there is no shortage of people wanting to work for the govt. aka Government Job ('Sarkari Naukri'). So the govt. just uses dozens of filters to sort out candidates.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               As an example, I will like to ask you, in which way is 'Indus Valley Civilisation' associated with being a loco pilot. I mean, like seriously. Loco Pilot, Train manager, TTE (Travelling Ticket Examiner) - these jobs are for I.T.I (Industrial Training Institute) and Polytechnic candidates. But in recent years 99% of these posts are filled with BTech candidates. This sucks.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The fun thing is this 'Sarkari Naukri' concept is losing its relevance day by day. The Govt. is rapidly privatizing its' sectors. This simply means the day when your Uncles and Father used to get monthly paychecks doing absolutely nothing in the office, is over.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                               Similar traits (even worse in my state) can be noticed regarding other Govt job positions.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                Coming to the Indian Armed Forces, let's be honest, writing 'PHEELING PROUD INDIAN ARMY'
                                with a bunch of emojis in the YouTube comment section
                                doesn't do shit in protecting the Nation.
                            </li>
                            <h5>I am gonna put it blatantly.</h5>
                            <li>
                                'Agniveer' recruitment scheme is obviously the best case scenario for the Armed Forces.
                                Some ex-Officers argue how much the recruits gonna
                                learn in 6 months of training, hampering the niche and cultures of a particular
                                regiment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                These are legit arguments. Even I don't like recruitment of non-Gorkhas in the prestigious Gorkha Regiment. Cause Gorkha's are built different. They have twice the amount of RBCs in their blood compared to normal people who live on plain lands. This mixing doesn't seem to be a good choice.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                But the major point is 'Pension'. Around 69% of the Army's defence budget is spent on
                                the pensions and salaries of its personnel.

                                This is not good. Warfare theses days has changed vastly. We need more advanced weapons (i.e. Precise Anti-Tank weapons, Advanced anti-tank defence systems on our tanks, supersonic and hypersonic cruise missiles, increasing the Nuclear arsenal considering our beloved neighbours, Aircraft carries, Weapons for destroying advanced Aircraft carries [i.e. China], Submarines, Swarm Drones, 5th-6th gen Fighter Aircrafts, advanced air defence system, A.I countermeasures for preventing border intrusions, modernization of Combat gears etc.), rather than a large number of troops. And the Army's way of solving this problem is:

                            <li style="font-style: italic;">

                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - 100k well-trained and well-equipped troops >> 1 million ill-motivated and very under-equipped troops
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - 4yr contract based recruitment (like those Tarkov PMCs).
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - Give your service Get your pay (no pension).
                            </li style="font-style: italic;">
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                               - 40 Lakh rupees for injured and 1 cr for death.
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - Recruiting candidates within the age group of 17 to 21 and keeping 25% of the
                                Agniveers permanent. (This is a really good decision)
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - No change in the recruitments of Officers (through SSB, NDA as usual)
                            </li>
                            <li style="font-style: italic;">
                                - SFs will be selected from that permanent 25 %

                            <li>
                               To those who are saying "what about those want to serve the country for the rest of their life i.e. true patriots?", please open your eyes and look around yourself. Do you, honestly from the core of your heart, think there is anything called 'true patriot' these days? The only thing people care about is self-gratification. And the Armed Force knows that very well. A high number of suicide cases and honey trap cases in the Army are burning proof of these.</li>

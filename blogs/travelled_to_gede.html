                            <li>
                               	I had this in my mind for a couple of while to visit Gede. Reason? I had never been there
                                before,
                                International Border is just ~1100m from the station (visible in naked eyes), wanted to
                                observe the
                                crew replacement of 13107 DOWN Dhaka-Kolkata Maitree Express (Bangladeshi staff members
                                deport the train
                                and Indian staff members and BSF take control of it). Gede is 90km from my location,
                                approx 2 hrs of journey
                                on SDAH-GEDE local.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After getting my journey plan approved by my parents I started researching more about
                                the train I will travel
                                in (31915 and 31922) and about Gede-Darshana zero point. Videos related to how to cross
                                borders from both sides
                                (legally of course!) were mostly from Bangladeshi YouTube channels. According to them,
                                the immigration process through
                                the Gede-Darshana border is very smooth compared to other checkpoints including one in
                                Radhikapur(Dist: Dinajpur) and in
                                Bangaon (Dist: N 24 Pgs) [Petrapole{IN} - Benapole{IN}].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To touch and cross the border there is a lot of
                                formality and processes you have to go through. After you got your Passport and Visa and
                                all other necessary documents
                                you gotta give ₹650 as travel tax (same amount for both sides).
                                Although crossing the India-Bangladesh border (legally) gotta be much simpler than most
                                other International borders,
                                going through all the hustle of getting my Visa and Taxes is not worth it for me. Cause
                                what am I gonna do after I step
                                into Bangladesh? I don't have any relatives there (many people in WB have their relatives
                                and ancestral properties in Bangladesh).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rather than applying for Visa and wasting my time just spending ₹25 on Sealdah - Gede
                                local seems
                                to be a much much better choice. 2 hrs long train journey + Rail Fanning + You can
                                see Bangladesh from Gede
                                Railway Station. So I scheduled my travel on Aug 29.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                1. Reach IP at about 1000
                                <br>
                                2. Board SDAH-GEDE local (31915) at 1037
                                <br>
                                3. See the stations between the RHA-GEDE route.
                                <br>
                                4. Reach Gede at 1245
                                <br>
                                5. Try to get as close as I can to the border without getting into any trouble.
                                <br>
                                6. After RailFanning for ~30mins return to Platform and wait for DOWN 13107 Maitree
                                Express.
                                <br>
                                7. Observe the crew exchange and all the procedures of an International Train.
                                <br>
                                8. Click photos of 13107 in Gede (if permissible only, otherwise just quietly observe)
                                <br>
                                9. Hop on DOWN 31922 GEDE-SDAH local (same train I used to board from KYI while
                                returning from College) at 1406
                                <br>
                                10. Reach back to IP at about 1630 and to home within 1700. Total 8 hrs of duration.

                            <li>Not 100 per cent :( Either 13107 was cancelled on Aug 29 or it was scheduled to arrive at
                                Gede after the
                                departure of 31922 (the exact train I preplanned to board). Because there is only one
                                down line in the GEDE-RHA route.
                                So only one train has to depart first from Gede and it was 31922. So I didn't get to see
                                down Maitree Express.

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                After landing on Gede I went straight ahead to capture pics of the train and the border.
                                I went up to the
                                BSF Immigration Checkpost (280 m from the station) to see the border more vividly. After
                                about 25 mins I returned to
                                the PF 1. While recording the platform I was interrupted by an Uncle that no video
                                recording is allowed on the station premises.
                                I was also informed (threatened tbh..) that I am under heavy CCTV surveillance and if
                                required they could
                                snatch away my phone and can get into huge legal trouble.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After that faceoff, I just put my phone immediately into my pocket and never pulled it
                                out before I depart from
                                Gede. So me going probably to the Checkpost and photographing stuff was probably
                                Illegal. I was
                                in fact under heavy CCTV surveillance. Not your average dead govt CCTVs, real legitimate
                                cameras installed around each
                                possible angle. It's an International Station after all.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When 31915 arrived at Gede there were no passengers in my coach except a few school
                                students who boarded the train from
                                Bagula came here just for fun. It was 1240 when I arrived. There were only 10
                                people are combining the whole 3 PFs.
                                Later I observed some Bangladeshi people arrive at Gede after verifying their docs
                                through the Immigration routes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It was a quiet place. Most of the houses I saw there belonged to the Officials.
                                Gede was surprisingly neat and clean.
                                I think it's the cleanest station I had ever seen. There is not a single piece of garbage
                                and dirt on the stations. No beggers
                                , no stalls either, only fencing and fencing. While my stay on the platform I saw
                                officials are keeping a strict eye on me.
                                That was intense but I finally managed to get enough pictures to satisfy my appetite.

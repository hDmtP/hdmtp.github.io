                        <h5><time>4th April, 2023</time> Hoogly Ghat (Naihati JN - Bandel JN route, Dist : Hoogly, just across the Hoogly river) journey on April 4</h5>
                        <ul>
                        	<li>
                        		So I just randomly decided that I will explore the RHA - BNJ section all by myself. It perfectly fit my timetable during CA4.
                        		But I thought of venturing short distance routes before literally hopping near the Bangladesh border.
                        	</li>
                        	<li>
                        		On Apr 4 while returning from College I dropped at NH and waited nearly 1.5 hrs in platform 1 & 2. I know this is one of the most
                        		dumbest decisions but, I am Dumb! I even thought of getting on 31324 cuz I frankly was tired of my own patience and wanted to say
                        		"screw you" to my silly little plan. 
                        	</li>
                        	<li>
                        		But finally 37539 arrived and I hoped in. After several minutes the train crossed the Hoogly river and I landed at Hoogly Ghat
                        		railway station. It was 43 C and overpowered sunshine. There were just a guy and a gal (probly from JIS) chatting in PF 1 and 
                        		me wondering in PF 2. Clicked some photos & videos. Went downstairs. Saw the place. Hoogly Imambara was nearby. The station is
                        		built like a metro station, on a bridge. The station is situated some 100-200 meters (~) from the Sampreeti bridge.
                        	</li>
                        	<li>
                        		Spotted some express trains skipping the station. Sealdah - Ballia express (ICF), Kolkata - Gorakhpur - Maliani Express (LHB),
                        		Sealdah - New Alipurduar Teesta Torsa Express (etc). Really enjoyed the return journey. It was an awesome view watching the NH-RHA
                        		route from NH-BDC route. From Naihati I returned to IP onboard Naihati Majherhat local (via Pricep Ghat). That was it.
                        	</li>

                            <li>
                               Got my final CA4 exam sorted out pretty well. Hurriedly left to catch an auto for Kalyani. Ngl felt bad for ignoring a toto
                               beside the college main gate. Hoped on an auto ~50 meters away from KLYS main entrance. Was praying for it to get enough passengers
                               so that it can depart. Eventually it got 4 other passengers and finally left for KYI at around 1240.

                        </ul>

                        	<li>
                        		Didn't waited for 31621 SDAH-RHA. It was still at NH as per WhereIsMyTrain. 31521 SDAH-STB arrived at 12xx. 9 coach. Platform 1 
                        		full of crowd consisting of varity of people, from old crippling people for their appointment in Hospital (my guess is Kalyani
                        		has the most high ranking hospital in Nadis dist.), students from different streams, exam/job candidates, people from straight up
                        		Chernobyl etc. But I was comfortable onboard. Infact not so long after I got a seat and after 2 stations I got a window seat.
                        	</li>
                        	<li>
                        		As for the work on the 3rd line, the track ended abruptly after a few distance from Kalyani. But the land aquisition is upto 
                        		Madanpur. Was wondering where are they gonna lay the 3rd track. There's literally no space, shops, houses etc. I guess railway is
                        		gonna just wipe them out (as all of these structures are within ER's boundary), make all necessary modifications and lay tracks.
                        		Seems like a shit load of work!

                        <ul>
							 <li>
								Landed on PF 1. Had alreay figured out where exactly PF 4 is from where Bangaon train arrives/departs. Opposite of PF 1 is PF2&3.
								If you go to the beginning of PF2&3, you will see that PF4 starts from there.

							 <li>
							 	By the time I arrived at RHA the Sun was at its peak performance for the day. Heat Waves!! There's only one shed in PF4, that too
							 	full. Literally every shop has some kind of drinks. Mineral Water, Soda, Lassi, Sugarcane Juice, Lemon juice etc. Didn't buy any.
							 	Phone was heating up. It was during all these suffering that 33726 BNJ RHA local arrived there at 1346. 12 coaches, BT carshed!
							 </li>
							 <li>
							 	Hopped on the fourth coach from the last. Was praying that it reaches Bangaon before 1520 or else I wont get the chance to click
							 	any pics on the station as it was scheduled to leave at 1520 (33728).
							 </li>
							 <li>
							 	Ma and Me agreed to receive a call from her at 1400 before leaving. It was near 1350 and Im inside the train which is now
							 	pretty much infested with vendors. I cant tell her that Im chilling in the classroom with the vendors shouting their products in
							 	background. But I got a perfect moment when there was no vendor in the coach and all the co-passengers were calm also. I utilised 
							 	this luck and called her myself. Told her all that she wanted to hear and I was pretty much tension free. 
							 </li>
						</ul>
						<h5><time>1426-1507</time> Ranaghat JN to Bangaon JN (32 km)</h5>
						<ul>
							 <li>
							  	33725 left at exactly 1426. It went on a curve and soon the BNJ route was at a 90 degree angle to the NH main line. Saw the Ranaghat
							  	EMU carshed. Quite big. Way bigger than BT. Soon the train picked up speed. There was 7 stations in between. Cooper Halt (skip, r),
							  	Nabaroynagar Halt (Nadia, left), Gangnapur (Nadia, left), Majhergram (Nadia, left, two lines, only station in the route 
							  	for crossing), Akaipur Halt (N 24 pgs, right), Gopalnagar (N 24 pgs, left), Satberia Halt (N 24 pgs, left).
							 </li>
							 <li>
							 	Train was reaching ~100kmph between stations. It was fking fun ride. Typical fields at the horizon can be observed. Rice fields
							 	have turned golden, no longer all green like in March. Some brick factories near Satberia. Completely village area (except Bangaon).
							 	The scenery was nice but
							 	Goghat route is still the best experience I 
							 	had ever in my life so far..

                            <li>
                               Train arrived at PF1. Landed on this town called Bangaon at an age of 20 years. Been hearing about this town since childhood.
                               Petrapole is only 4km away. Sealdah North line (BT - BNJ) comes perpendicularly and joins with the RHA track and combined take a 
                               turn in the left towards Khulna, Bangladesh. Kolkata Khulna international train "Bandhan" express goes over this station.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            	33840 Down Bangaon Sealdah local was at PF3. Expected it at PF 2. Elevator installation is on the way. Took a couple of pictures
                            	near PF 2&3, the tracks coming from Sealdah and obviously the station board. Was thinking of going outside the station and see the
                            	town but it was already 1517. So I hopped on coach number 3 from the front (hybrid vendor coach). This time I sat on the right side
                            	(perspective : towards BNJ) so as to cover Akaipur Halt and Coopers Halt.

                        		I went a distance of 58 km without anyone knowing about it. Thats the longest secret solo trip of mine ever. For now I dont have 
                        		any other secret trip like this. I have 2 more plausible targets though, Krishnanagar City JN (fked up train schedule) and Kalyani - 
                        		Tribeni - BDC - NH journey (includes road trip where I have to cross the Hoogly river on Ishwar Gupta Setu..)

                        	<li>
                        		The fact that they couldn't think of the fact that this little sh!t has travelled to Bangaon solo is just an awesome mysterious
                        		feeling. HaHa you will never know that I have been to Bangaon JN all alone doing a continuos 5 hour journey amidst a heat wave.

                        		Was this a stupid decision? Yes! But it bears a great significance for me. Someway it aids to the level of delusion required to 
                        		romanticize my detachment from my own humanity.

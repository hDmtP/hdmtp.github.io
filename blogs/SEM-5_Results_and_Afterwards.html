                        <p>SGPA : 8.83</p> 
                        <ul>
                            <h5>Expect the unexpected. But this time the unexpected is actually good.</h5> 
                            <li>
                            	I did not expect to stretch my score this far in my first OFFLINE exam. I did all I could to atleast get over 6.75 (60%) to keep
                            	my scholarship secure. I didnt even attend that many classes (near 0 actually ðŸ˜¬). I probably had the lowest internal marks (that
                            	one given from the college) because of this. And yet not only did I get a shocking 8.83, I somehow topped in my class. How tf is
                            	this possible? My CA, PCA, attendance was way way low than those top dogs in my class. In addition to that they all had their own
                            	well-established cheat supply chain networks during the exam. They had the whole MAKAUT organizer micro xeroxed with them. 
                            	
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            	They are flabbergasted. Not because I topped. But because I was writing all my papers by my own. I neither accepted their cheats nor 
                            	passed their cheats to others. Didn't want to be in the crossfire. I also secured my MAR (Mandatory Additional Requirements) points 
                            	for 3rd year which is also a big
                            	relief.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            	In these 2 decades of my life I have seen one thing is common. The thing I absolutely did not expect, the alternate possibility
                            	that my mind did'nt come across at all ends up happening. This case is no different either. Forget about getting the highest marks,
                            	I was worrying if I would even be able to attend my exams due to my low attendance. When that was sorted out my next trouble was
                            	if I was gonna pass all my subjects. Because this was the first ever offline semester exam for the 2020 batch. I wasn't sure how hard the 
                            	checking is going to be. The paper was to be checked twice, 1. Digitally, 2. Manually by the teachers. If marks from the both are the
                            	same then that is it, or else it will be checked again.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                        	<h5>Afterwards...</h5>
                        	<li>
                        		So recently I have developed some inclination towards Quantum Mechanics. Especially its application in Cryptography (e.g. Quantum
                        		Key Distribution, where we use the polarization/color/hard-or-soft property of photons in a Quantum Entanglement to verify the
                        		authenticity of data. Any interruption in the photon transmission will led to different results due to quantum superposition.)
                        		At first I was following the MIT OpenCourseWare playlist for Quantum Mechanics. But soon I realized that those 80 min videos are 
                        		more focused on their semester syllabus and problem sets more than the concepts. Since then I have found better sources such as
                        		Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC).

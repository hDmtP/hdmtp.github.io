                            <li>Makarov and General Shepard was working together not as a team but to reach their own
                                goals. Basically used to spark world War 3. Think about it. Why would a general hand
                                pick a private in the army that's just did one battle to do a top secret cia mission
                                that general Shepard said himself "it cost a lot of money to get you next time him" also
                                markov is very smart and use the private Cia puppet and killed him off at the end like
                                it was a gift from Shepard. In real life we know the Cia is sparking wars all around the
                                world. Definitely sticks to the theme of modern warfare. Good thing both of them Is
                                dead. [source: Kidyugi1]

                                "1.first of all you should remove the battery right after opening the laptop ( not later
                                lol)
                                2.then press the power button for 10 sec so that any power remaining is completely
                                discharged otherwise you can short your motherboard.
                                3. Never use any metal thing to open the battery connector use plastic pry tools
                                otherwise your battery connector can be damaged.

                                pls make sure to follow this steps in future. people generally ignore these steps and
                                then go to service center with shorted mobo.


                                I have used Noctua NT-H1, arctic MX-4 and cooler master mastergel pro.
                                cooler master mastergel pro is the best thermal paste in the market in terms of
                                performance and Value for money.

                                Device - Asus TUF A15 GTX 1650 2020 model, the model which was trolled for it's higher
                                temps.
                                Now while gaming & rendering temps are hovering around 85 C to 90 C.

                                Conclusion: Thermals system are more or less same everywhere , what matters is the
                                quality of the Thermal paste." - Dipanjan Roy</li>

                                at track no. 1. Mid-aged woman in saree. Along with her was probably her daughter. ~11
                                yrs old. It appeard that they will cross track no 1 before the UP train approaches the
                                position. But suddenly victim sat down on the track. Her daughter was seen pulling her
                                mother's hand in panic, to drag her to safety. But when the train comes really close,
                                the girl just slightly gets away from the track. The train collides with the woman.
                                After the train has gone, her body was seen 25-30 foot away from her sitting position".
                                No further details came from my father. Its very sad the poor girl had to go through
                                that.

                        Writing after more than a week. Didnt do much during these time, just YouTube & Russia-Ukraine.
                        But on 03 Jun Mrs. Ar Bsu notified on the official college group that some students havent yet
                        collected
                        enough MAR point. Threshold 25 pts. Mine was 5. A big LOL regarding the post made on
                        <time>14-05-2022</time>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Fcuk, just realised that it will be `05`, not `04`. Gotta redo that. Wait... Ok done. If u wanna
                        see
                        which human error I am referring to, u can check the <a href="/feed.xml"

                        Ok so no doubt I was fucking scared (Cuz madam phone called me & told I was gonna fail the sem).
                        Then I "TRIED" to think about the worst possible outcome. I have to compensate for the MAR
                        points in the next semester.

                        <li>I then started watching a French lecture on Cursa. Btw Cursa stores it's users' password in
                            plain text, WTF!</li>

                        <li>Also provided that ‚Çπ1000 fest e-certificate. It gave me just 3 pts</li>
                        <li>Today [6th June] I saw the portal and I got a total of 24 pts. For 1 more pts I sent an
                            e-certificate on online enterprenureship programm. Lets see if it works.</li>
                        <li>06 called me 3th June & 6th June(today) regarding AICTE internship website register & login

                        My rant about World Politics (not Russia-Ukraine):
                        <details>
                            Israel - Palestine conflict. Gaza, Hamas. Middle East == OIL; USA doesnt want RUSSIA to
                            influence Middle East == Russia's main economy(Weapon + Oil) -> Russian weapon not in that
                            demand + Russia cant take oil from Gulf countries; USA wants to keep Middle East against
                            Russia; Hence USA never wants Gulf area to be peaceful; If Gulf countries(like Syria) sets
                            up good relation with Russia -> USA gives Israel full permission(indirectly) to do whatever
                            the fuck it wants to defend itself against Islamic terrorism; But USA keeps the UN engaged
                            in discussion who is good or bad; Meanwhile USA keeps buying Crude OIL in very cheaper
                            rate(8$/gallon) from organisations affiliated to ISIS, Hezbolla itself, W H A T?? -> That
                            means Washington wants to keep fighting with terrorists in the Middle East -> But they doent
                            want to completely wipe out them, just keep them engaging for as long as they get Crude Oil
                            in much cheaper rate and they keep as much as Crude oil as they can as a Reserve; That means
                            your Country DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOUR ARMY PERSONNEL's LIFE -> THE EACH INDIVIDUAL
                            OPERATORS ON WHOM THE COUNTRY SPENDS MILLIONS -> ITS JUST SIMPLE BUSINESS -> YOU R JUST A
                            PAWN. And lets be honest, if u have oil, u literally have everything ==
                            money+army+navy+airforce+nation wide transportation+energy production ; What else do u need?
                            -> Middle East runs out of its OIL Reserve -> Its value ends for USA -> TESLA(Elon Musk)
                            will work as a catalyst in this process -> So as long as USA does'nt get fully independent
                            from Fossil Fuel, they gotta Suck all the OIL outa Middle East. Sometimes I wonder if 9/11
                            was staged by C I A itself...Thats why I never like the idealogy that goes, "This is Bob. He
                            is a simple boy. 9/11 happens. He decides to kill terrorists. So he joins the Army. Gets
                            deployed in AFG/IRAQ. Kills dozen of terrorists. One day he became KIA. His country gives
                            him one of the highest Gallantry award. His deeds inspire the country's youth. Meanwhile its
                            the same country that staged the attack, Bob's whole life decision and his death. People
                            like Bob are relics, but those 0.000001% controls the sentiments of boys and girls, men and
                            women, every human being. May be Im also controlled/manipulated by them in some way. This is
                            not bitching on USA, literally every country follows(including India also. Will rant about
                            her later) this kinda shady fcuked up shit. US is just the prime example in this case. Thats
                            why I like MW2 so much. Gen. Shepherd is the burning example of what I wrote. USA dosent
                            flinch at torture. If u r someone against their road, they will assasinate u no matter how
                            good of a person u r.

                            Conclusion : USA wants to keep Middle East a zone of Turbulence as loong as it is gaining
                            Profit.

                            Now there can be a similiar kind of angle in the currently ongoing Russian invasion of
                            Ukraine.

                            If u ever feel useless, remember World Politics. They (those 0.000001%) wants us to keep in
                            illusion. But u gotta find ur inner self(the purest one) and complete ur duty as a human
                            being on this Earth. Shit!

                        and extremists, ISI agents, ..basically a cartel for anti-national activities.
                        Beef hanging every 10 feet away, surrounded by 4-6 floor buildings (most of them build
                        illegally). All the native Bengalis are starting to shift to Behala.
                        CBI(Father counters saying they r volunteer forces) raids in the area frequently. These men, as
                        described by my mother & her sisters, "Around 6'5'' in height, Heavy Set, Rounded & Twisted
                        moustache". They dont give a shit.
                        They are picking anyone they suspect and beating the living shit outta them if they r somehow
                        related to crime. At midnight, ~12 yr old drunken kids create nuisance in the road,
                        bombs exploding/gun fire in a distance. Place is filled illiterate cnuts. The only sad thing is
                        my late old man's house is soon gonna replaced with such Apartments.

                        Bace Bridge is not a good place, pickpocketers rule the area.

                        <li>Arrived at destination at 10:29. Train was stopped at KPA for 44 minutes. Protest by BJP in
                            RHA lead to delay down RHA-SDAH local. It caused the down KLYM-SDAH local stuck at KYI.

                            That day I didnt got a seat even after NH (I didnt tried though..). But I got to seat for 40
                            mins at KPA, lel. That situation reminded me of the time when I was onboard SDAH-RHA local
                            and the train got stuck due to protest at SNR. I was on my way for 1st round of JEE MAINS.
                            That was the first time I got to visit the KYI-KLYS branch line. Now I travel thrice a month
                            on that line . Also I noticed Tapajit just opposite to where I was standing. I think he also
                            noticed me. May be relocated to another coach while in KPA.

                            series) rake. Boarded it. That Protest had obvsly fcuked up the timeline. Reached KLYM at
                            14:25. Departed after 8 mins instead of 15 mins at 14:33. Waited a long a** time at KYI.
                            Forgot (fcuk me!) when it arrived at IP. May be ~ 15:12. Reached home before 16:00 for sure.

                    <text>
                        Today 31319 showed up with a 12 coach 12000 series old ICF rake from RHA carshed, pretty
                        unusual (its always 9 coach rake from NKG)! Down 31528 was 13000 old ICF rake (9 coaches) from
                        BT. Forgot the room no (on 2nd
                        floor) where I stayed for a while and then have to leave cuz it was scheduled for an exam.
                        Have to get into room no 401 on 3rd floor. I was recreating stuffs from Soap's Journal. Rakesh
                        asked me tf was I doin. I kept silent (shouldn't have..). That got the attentions of the others
                        in that room. Soon a psycological and mental bullying environment started wrapping around me.
                        One guy who always ignored me when I asked him smthing before asked me what was I doin. I
                        ignored him. This got him pissed (from the inside). Then he got his both legs pulled on the high
                        bench I was working on and kept staring in my face in a dominate way. One other guy kept asking
                        me baseless stuffs which I also ignored. Could have slapped me in the head or something
                        similiar. But the situation didnt escalated any further.

                        Both trains were 50000 series BEML rake this time. UP: BT ; DOWN: NKG. Literally all rooms of
                        all floors were conducting exam today. Didnt got a seat(on train) while
                        returning. Its getting discomfortable to paddle my cycle on uneven roads. Then when I return
                        home (16:14) the electricity was gone! But wasnt that much of a problem to me. Cuz Parul Pankha
                        from Gobardanga got my back. Electricity came back at 16:45.

                            after scrutinizing all the topics. I really wish üôè I reach the Threshold. Btw this made me
                            go
                            to the roofs after more than 2 months (dont worry, I myself am surprised!).

                            95% of them are full of stereotypes. Tbh there is always a degree of bias from whatever

                        intense raining & thunderstorm so far in 2022 (due to Cyclone Asani). She says it started at ~

                    <text>
                        Still there is a spelling mistake in my Surname. I remember visiting the Administrative Service
                        Office in Barrackpore for my Voter Id processes around 2 yrs ago. Fcuked up hot weather with
                        +80% humidity
                        and those irritating angry ass officials in the counter. There was a huge queue. After
                        waiting more than 3 hrs
                        my time came and I submitted the documents (which was already rejected twice by the officials
                        becuz of its incompleteness. Dad went twice on cylce to home to fetch the other docs. Reason, 1.
                        we didnt do much research regarding the process as I had no intention of moving my ass to go
                        there; 2. they didnt had any clear cut guidelines regarding the process) to a female clerk. She
                        rapidly scanned them and asked (yellingwas more like it) me for my Birth certificate. I didnt
                        have
                        that. I asked politely, "why?". - "To confirm ur D O B". Me: "Thats on my Adhaar card". She
                        thought
                        something for a while and then said "DONE! Now get outta the queue". I thought it was Done! But
                        after couple of months I realised All that sweat and energy
                        we wasted there was all in vain. My voter id never arrived (prev yr). So I (my Mom did all the
                        work basically) had to do it once more. This time through local political party and it was
                        quick.

                        I was able to vote for the municipality this yr without my voter card though. As the officials
                        had proof that I was an eligible candidate.

                        Talking about other stuffs that happened today, I finished BrBa Season 1 today and I am about to
                        complete watching
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYR08uijgZE&t=10980s" target="_blank">WaW on Veteran (4
                            hrs long)</a>. Man watching this game on Veteran gives me anxiety. Imagine
                        playing it irl. Also imagine of the soldiers who went through this irl. Life is a painfull
                        process. Each step forward gives exponentially higher challenges. There is no fixed level of
                        Worse. There is smthing always Worser the the Worse, e.g. no one is the Final Boss.

                        Also those dreams mentioned in my prev. post still haunts me. Need to control my mind.

                        (15:45). So
                        getting more nostalgic. Old memories from my tution batches haunted me in my dream this morning.
                        This shit is getting more frequent due to daily rainy weather. Man, I really like the mixture of

                            Arrived at IP at 15:00 (at this time I would have just reached KYI bruhh..) and home at
                            15:17
                            (by this time I would have still been in KYI).

                            At around 00:04 (day of posting this blog basically) I clicked to watch Nikto's voicelines
                            on
                            youtube. 24 mins long. So I laid down on my bed, wearing headset, to listen to it. Then mom
                            came
                            and wake me up at 02:49. F U C K. My laptop on, wifi, router still on, mobile still on
                            charging.
                            Just shutdown my laptop, turned off wifi and headed for sleep. She was not mad this time.
                            After
                            waking up at 9:17, I saw my phone was still on charging (üò¨). Gladly it wasnt on fast
                            charging
                            mode.

                        <li>3. 11:12 Librarian didnt show up. So the library was closed. It was the only cold and
                            confortable place in the entire clg. So we ended up in the 1st floor. It was hot. But soon
                            we
                            abandoned it as the room was scheduled for a class. So we went to the 2nd floor and found
                            ourselves an empty room. It was more hotter. Anyways we (4 guys) somehow passed our time.

                            Place was crawling with couples (couples r fucking everywhere!). At 13:42 I suggested them
                            lets
                            visit the 3rd floor and the rooftop also. No one of us have been there before. In 3rd floor
                            2 of
                            us locked me and the other guy in a small room (avg joke). But soon they discovered buch of
                            blank papers, copies and a WBUT Maths Book. They took em all (I didnt even stole a dust frm
                            that
                            almirah but I dont care). We visited the roofs. All I saw was a worker and
                            bunch of beer bottles.

                                1.&nbsp; I saw this rss thing on their website. I decided (or procastinated) to look
                                into it

                                2.&nbsp; Next day arrived. My lazy a$$ just browsed a few youtube videos regarding rss.
                                All
                                I
                                found
                                was
                                dudes from 2009-2012 talking about wordpress and integrating rss feed there. I
                                immediately
                                lost
                                interest and closed those videos. I also Google searched the term RSS and all I
                                understood
                                that

                                purpose is to
                                get the users updated whenever a site publishes their latest blog/article. I told myself
                                that
                                its
                                useless to me as
                                &nbsp;nowadays there are plenty of ways to get a user updated of latest blog articles.
                                So I
                                stopped
                                thinking about it.

                                4. &nbsp; The day of publishing this blog. Approximately near the evening the group
                                admins
                                decided
                                to integrate RSS feed from various site to their group. So I kinda started wondering
                                about
                                RSS
                                again. Then got the RSS link of one of those guy's website and found out .xml file.
                                After
                                going
                                through the xml file I mostly understood about RSS and added this feature in my website
                                too.

                                life. Main reasons for me to choose that clg is , 1. Fees Structure,
                                2. Ease of travel, 3. Less amount of mandatory strict rules compared to other clgs. So

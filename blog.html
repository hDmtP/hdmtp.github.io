                    <li>1. Woke up at 7:20</li>
                    <li>2. Reached KLYS at 9:53</li>
                    <li>3. ~14:10 A couple started making out in an empty classroom, disregarding the fact that I was
                        also present
                        there with them in that same room</li>
                    <li>4. At around 13:40 more that a dozen of Seniors arrived like a group of DOGS during the month of
                        AUG/SEP (didnt get
                        the reference? lol!) for collecting that ₹1000. Around 13 losers just surrounded me and tried to
                        explain me the consequences of their demand's negation.</li>
                    <li>5. ~14:55 Bought myself a Pepsi (750ml/₹40) after reaching KYI</li>
                    <li>6. 15:35 Got <a href="https://indiarailinfo.com/train/17856" target="_blank">[31528]</a>, less
                        crowd till NH, but Heat wind f'cked me up.</li>
                    <li>7. ~16:15 Arrived at home.</li>

                    3. So after the first part of CA3 (Discrete Math.) I headed towards the Library at around 11:13. For
                    first 8 mins it was quiet, low heat, very few people.

                    Was perfectly fine with their presence. But u know whats the
                    problem with these dipshits, they came and started fucking my mind up even though I was minding my
                    own business. Listen up Dipshits, I am a creature who has adapted to the crushing pressure and
                    oppressive darkness. From being bullied by my cousins to my tution teachers (especially my art
                    teacher) to my classmates from the nursery to 12th class, but still not broken, still trying to
                    find smthing worth living for, shits like these doesnt bother me now. If u r reading this somehow,
                    put this in ur pea-sized brain that
                    you fall under those peoples whom I dont give a fuck. Literally all of my previous classmates (i.e.
                    from HS Tution, High School, Middle School and I dont really remember much about my nursery)
                    come undr this category. So u can 1. GO FUCK URSELF. 2. DESTROY THE WHOLE UNIVERSE, 3. BECOME A
                    FRICKING GOD, these shits doesnt bother me. Cuz u, little piece of shit stains, u DO NOT MATTER. I
                    repeat U DO NOT
                    MATTER, UR EXISTANCE IS OF NO SIGNIFICANCE to me. So u, rotten cocksuckers, GO, EAT SHIT and D I E
                    while I live in the Simulation. This is the last time Im going to waste my time on these worthless
                    piece of craps.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So becuz of this I left the library room and started looking for a less crowded classroom in the
                    ground floor. Here all the rooms were crawling with Seniors. So I kinda hopelessly went to 1st floor
                    to check if there was any. Fortunately I found one of my choice at around 12:42. That class room was
                    pretty big. 3 columns of benches with 8 benches in each column. I took a seat at the 3rd bench in
                    middle column. I was really having a good time as I always do when Im alone. At around 12:55 a girl
                    (probly a senior) asked me
                    from the doorway if I was giving an exam there (which is strange in 2 ways, 1. Everybody knows the
                    2nd exam starts from 14:00, and 2. Literally every girl/lady bugs the fuck out whenever they see my
                    expressionless face.). I replied that no no Im just sitting here under the fan becuz of the
                    scorching heat outside. She said okay and
                    then called in a dude who was standing nearby. That dude looked kinda hesitant. I even heard him
                    whispering to her, 'I dont think this is the right place'. His caution seemed to be regarding my
                    presence. By that time I understood that they were a couple. But his gf insisted that they should
                    stay in this room for now as there is heatwave outside in the campus. So they took a sit at 7th
                    bench of the 1st column, 3 benches behind me on my right side. Her bf started playing f'cking
                    romantic bollywood songs in his mobile and started chatting with each other. Now, I have been
                    through such
                    hrs where I will try to be as much focused as I can on my phone while couples around me do their
                    relationship stuffs. But this couple just went too far. While I was busy reading notes I started
                    hearing a sound. From all the porns I have watched so far, I could say that sound was the result of
                    friction between two sloppy lips, i.e. they were intimately kissing. They were tightly closed to
                    each other, studying & discussing their notes together and kissing each other after a specific
                    interval. This isnt probably smthing strange for a couple BUT HOW THE HELL COULD THEY IGNORE THE
                    FACT that there is a guy sitting next to them, without wearing any headphones and fully conscious of
                    his surroundings. Whats even worse is that I
                    cant even turn around and stare at them making out. All I did is take a quick glance to confirm my
                    thought process and YES, they were already in 1st base. I can hear them talking about marrying each
                    other after their graduation and how much she love him followed by multiple intimate kiss. Now I am
                    someone who is already dead inside.
                    I was not really in a state of comparing myself with them. The thing that is still bugging the f'ck
                    outta me is, was it a really good idea to get intimate in a room where another guy was also present
                    and can literally record that shit and circulate it around the whole clg although Im not that kinda
                    ahole.
                    They probably thought that either I would not notice or Im just a dumbass they dont care about.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    4. A gr of Seniors entered in the hall and started acting like a desi gangstar to the other popular
                    a$$holes of my class. They were doing their shit while I was sitting in a corner probably thinking
                    they will not notice me. But finally 4 Seniors approached me and circled around me. One of them ,
                    being a jerk, barked at me to stand up but them immediately another one of them told him to stop as
                    he probably knew that behaviour comes under ragging. Then they started saying that it is compulsory
                    in every other clgs, its ur fest, come and eat shit in this fest. Meanwhile that jerk, resting his
                    hand over my shoulders, kept barking that Im a good boy and that I should pay the money. Bro u can
                    eat the hairest part of my ass if u think that kinda attitude lmao. They made me say yes to their
                    demands and leaves. I mean what can I do in such situation. My hands r tied with legal rules. I
                    literally have no weapon to fight with them except my bare hands. But meeling dozen of them with my
                    bare hands is probably not a good idea. Atleast need a knife or dagger will be enough to neutralize
                    25% of them. And with a handgun, the probability becomes 80%. But again my hands r tied with laws. 5
                    mins after they leave, my mother calls me to ask about the seniors regarding the ₹1000. What an
                    instinct! Anyways she advised me not to take any troubles and give them the ₹1000 next day. But one
                    thing for sure, they r going to pay, at some point in their life, Trust me :)

                    5. Exam finished before 15:00. Bought a Pepsi bottle even though there were many better alternatives
                    like Mnt Dew, lassi, Ampanna, Various drinks of Amul, Mazza, Frooti but no Sprite :( Never gonna buy
                    pepsi next time as it contain Caffeine.

                        Just becuz I go to sleep late at night! Well lets see what u r gonna do about it. Woke me up
                        at 7:30. + ordering me to go to the saloon even when I told her Im not willing to do so. Though
                        her
                        advice was pretty solid (Saturday => less crowd, + Summer + Upcoming 30 hrs of time waste) but
                        my
                        lazy
                        introvert ass didnt wanted to step outside. It was very much acceptable if she would'v declared
                        me a
                        dumbass (which I am) BUT she lost her sh*t and started yelling at me like a maniac.
                        <br><br>
                        Cleaning the whole ass house, washing clothes & dishes, cooking foods, paying Internet &
                        Electricity
                        bills - these r the things Im depended upon them (parents). My primary focus is to pay for the
                        Internet &
                        Electricity by my own (this is one of the major target for most of the people around my age).

                            Purpose? Well our family members needed to sumbmit their biometric id for our Ration Card.
                            So I had to go there in person. Otherwise I would've been in my home for straight 3 weeks.
                            Also first time in my life I spotted an Electric Vehicle in my hometown as well as irl.
                            Unfortunately, I couldnt snap a pic of it and also cant remeber its damm name except
                            it started with letter 'L'. The design was way good than I expected it to be as an
                            indigenious

                            For the past 3 days I was wondering wtf is this RSS feed link on each of these guys'
                            website.
                            <br><br>
                            1.&nbsp; I saw this rss thing on their website. I decided (or procastinated) to look into it
                            the
                            next day.

                            2.&nbsp; Next day arrived. My lazy a$$ just browsed a few youtube videos regarding rss. All
                            I
                            found
                            was
                            dudes from 2009-2012 talking about wordpress and integrating rss feed there. I immediately
                            lost
                            interest and closed those videos. I also Google searched the term RSS and all I understood
                            that
                            it's
                            purpose is to
                            get the users updated whenever a site publishes their latest blog/article. I told myself
                            that
                            its
                            useless to me as
                            &nbsp;nowadays there are plenty of ways to get a user updated of latest blog articles. So I
                            stopped
                            thinking about it.

                            3. &nbsp; Didnt do much about rss. <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/S.S.D.D."

                            4. &nbsp; The day of publishing this blog. Approximately near the evening the group admins
                            decided
                            to integrate RSS feed from various site to their group. So I kinda started wondering about
                            RSS
                            again. Then got the RSS link of one of those guy's website and found out .xml file. After
                            going
                            through the xml file I mostly understood about RSS and added this feature in my website too.

                            + the Education System has become a CULT. Plus there is also a few students who just always
                            wants to
                            dominate each and every environment. Anything goes slightly against
                            their plans and they will start a drama (<note>to catch attention</note>). In my first yrs I
                            didnt
                            understand wtf
                            is wrong. Cuz I didnt know back then that this kinda shitty
                            syndrome was a thing. Funny thing is infact a guy in my class had multiple face off with
                            that
                            dude.
                            He literally dropped out in 3rd sem just becuz he couldnt bear with that kinda shit (<note>
                                Although
                                he
                                himself was kinda partially responsible in that scenario. Moreover he was also
                                financially
                                independent through his online business (<note>seemingly..</note>)</note>). Before
                            getting
                            admission to any clg or
                            university I have gone through tones of

                            and also Quora('<note>..Im really sorry for my past self but hey, u learn from ur mistakes:)

                            '). What I got
                            from all these is no matter how worse ur clg is, u will meet people who will be contrary to
                            the
                            main
                            stream. For example, creating helpful and interesting Repositories, understanding the
                            concepts
                            and
                            algorithms of COmpetitive Programming and its implication in real
                            life problem solving, getting our hands dirty in open-source projects. I had read about such
                            stories
                            alot. But ohh my poor soul... \'Always expect the unexpected\'. Now Im in 4th semester and
                            what
                            I
                            understand is all they

                                older than us</note>) and peers' attention, getting laid(i.e. the guys) and getting
                            into a relationship(i.e. the girls), maintaining their domination etc. These seems to be

                            worser

                            From my past experience from my High School I think faking friendship with them is valueless

                            my
                            life. Main reasons for me to choose that clg is , 1. Fees Structure,
                            2. Ease of travel, 3. Less amount of mandatory strict rules compared to other clgs. So yeah,
